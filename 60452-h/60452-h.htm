  <h2 class='c005'>OFF SANDY HOOK</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>On board the Rampatina liner, eleven days and a half
out from Liverpool, the usual terrific sensation created
by the appearance of the pilot-yacht prevailed. Necks
were craned and toes were trodden on as the steamer
slackened speed, and a line dexterously thrown by a
blue-jerseyed deck-hand was caught by somebody aboard
the yacht. The pilot, not insensible to the fact of his
being a personage of note, carefully divested his bearded
countenance of all expression as he saluted the Captain,
and taking from the deck-steward’s obsequiously proffered
salver a glass containing four-fingers of neat Bourbon
whisky, concealed its contents about his person without
perceptible emotion, and went up with the First
Officer upon the upper bridge as the relieved skipper
plunged below. The telegraphs clicked their message—the
leviathan hulk of the liner quivered and began to
forge slowly ahead, and an intelligent-looking, thin-lipped,
badly-shaved young man in a bowler, tweeds,
and striped necktie, introduced himself to the Second
Officer as an emissary of the Press.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr. Cyrus K. Pillson, <cite>New York Yeller</cite>....
Pleased to know you, sir,” said the Second Officer; “step
into the smoke-room, this way. Bar-steward, a brandy
cocktail for me, and you, sir, order whatever you are
most in the habit of hoisting. Whisky straight! Now,
sir, happy to afford you what information I can!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I presume,” observed the young gentleman of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>Press, settling himself on the springy morocco cushions
and accepting the Second Officer’s polite offer of a green
Havana of the strongest kind, “that you have had a
smooth passage, considerin’ the time of year?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Smooth....” The Second Officer carefully reversed
in his reply the Pressman’s remark: “Well, yes,
the time of year considered, a smooth passage, I take it,
we <em>have</em> had.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No fogs?” interrogated the young gentleman, clicking
the elastic band of a notebook which projected from
his breast-pocket.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fogs?... No!” said the Second Officer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You didn’t chance,” pursued the young gentleman
of the Press, taking his short drink from the steward’s
salver and throwing it contemptuously down his throat,
“to fall in with a berg off the Bank, did you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not a smell of one!” replied the Second Officer with
decision.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ran into a derelict hencoop, perhaps?” persisted the
young gentleman, concealing the worn sole of a wearied
boot from the searching glare of the electric light by
tucking it underneath him, “or an old lady’s bonnet-box?
... or a rubber doll some woman’s baby had
lost overboard? No?” he echoed, as the Second Officer
shook his head. “Then, how in thunder did you manage
to lose twenty feet of your port-rail?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Carried away,” said the Second Officer, offering the
young Press gentleman a light.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, thanks. Always eat mine,” said the young Press
gentleman gracefully.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Matter of taste,” observed the Second Officer, blowing
blue rings.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I guess so; and I’ve a taste for knowing how you
came,” said the young Pressman, “to part with that
twenty foot of rail.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Carried away,” said the Second Officer.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>“I kin see that,” retorted the visitor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was carried away,” said the Second Officer, “by
an elephant.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A pet you had running about aboard?” queried the
Pressman, with imperturbable coolness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A passenger,” returned the Second Officer, with
equal calm.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a snap, and the Pressman’s notebook was
open on his knee. The pencil vibrated over the virgin
page, when a curious utterance, between a wail, a cough,
and a roar, made the hand that held it start.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yarr-rr! Ohowgh! Yarr!” The melancholy sound
came from without, borne on the cool breeze of a late
afternoon in March, through the open ventilators.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Might that,” queried the young gentleman of the
Press, “be an expression of opinion on the part of the
elephant?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lord love you, no!” said the Second Officer. “It’s
the leopard.” He added after a second’s pause: “Or
the puma.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you happen to have a menagerie aboard?” inquired
the Pressman, making a note in shorthand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, sir. The beasts—elephants, leopards, and a box
of cobras—are invoiced from the London Docks to a
wealthy amateur in New York State. Not an iron king,
or a corn king, or a cotton king, or a pickle king, or a
kerosene king,” said the Second Officer, with a steady
upper lip, “but a chewing-gum king.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you mean Shadland C. McOster,” said the Pressman,
“my mother is his cousin. They used to chew
gum together in school recess, sir, little guessing that
Shad would one day soar, on wings made of that article,
to the realms of gilded plutocracy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I rather imagine the name you mention to be the
right one,” said the Second Officer cautiously, “but I
won’t commit myself. The beasts shipped from Liverpool
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>are intended as a present for the purchaser’s infant
daughter on her fifth birthday.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yarr-rr! Ohowgh! Ohowgh!” Again the coughing
roar vibrated through the smoke-room. Then the
chorus of “Hail Columbia!” rose from the promenade
deck, where the lady passengers were assembled ready
to wave starred and striped silk pocket-handkerchiefs
and exchange patriotic sentiments at the first glimpse
of land.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s not what I should call a humly voice, that of
the leopard,” observed the Pressman, controlling a slight
shiver.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Children have queer tastes,” said the Second Officer.
“And it’s as well Old Spots is lively, as Bingo’s
dead.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bingo?” queried the Pressman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bingo was the elephant,” said the Second Officer,
passing the palm of his brown right hand over his upper
lip as the Pressman made a few rapid notes. “And if
the particulars of the deathbed scene are likely to be
of any interest to you—why, you’re welcome to ’em!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re white!” said the Pressman warmly, licking
his pencil. “What did your elephant die of?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Seasickness!” said the Second Officer calmly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve seen a few things worth seeing—myself,” said
the Pressman enviously, “but not a seasick elephant.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“With a professional lady-nurse in attendance,” said
the Second Officer; “all complete from stem to stern,
in her print gown, white apron, fly-away cap-rigging,
and ward shoes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Pressman grunted, but not from lack of interest.
Doubled up in the corner of the smoke-room divan, his
notebook balanced on his bulging shirt-front, he made
furious notes. The Second Officer waited until the pencil
seemed hungry, and then fed it with a little more information.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>“When that girl came aboard at Liverpool with her
mackintosh and holdall and little black shiny bag,” he
went on, “I just noticed her in a passing sort of way as
a fresh-colored, tidy-looking young woman, rather plump
in the bows, and with an air as though she meant to get
her full money’s worth out of her eleven-pound fare.
But our cheap tariff had filled the passenger-lists fairly
full, and I’d a long score of things to attend to. A
special derrick had had to be rigged to sling the elephant’s
cage aboard, and a capital one it was, of sound
Indian teak strengthened with steel—must have cost a
mint of money. We stowed it, after a lot of sweat and
swearing, on the promenade deck, abaft the funnels,
bolting it to rings specially screwed in the deck, passing
a wire hawser across the top, which was made fast to
the port and starboard davits, and rigging weather-screens
of double tarpaulin to keep Bingo warm and
dry. The other beasts we shipped under the lee of
the forward cabin skylight; and I’d just got through the
job when a quiet ladylike voice at my elbow says:</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘If you please, officer, with regard to my patient, I
wish to know——’</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Ask the purser, ma’am,’ I said, rather snappishly,
for I was hot and worried ... ‘or the head-stewardess.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘I have asked them both,’ says the voice in a calm,
determined way, ‘and have been referred to you.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Well, what is it?’ says I.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘By mistake,’ says the young lady—for a young
lady she was, and a hospital nurse besides, neatly rigged
out in the usual uniform—‘by mistake I have had allotted
to me a bedroom on the ground-floor, so far from
my patient that I cannot possibly hear him should he
call me in the night. And,’ she went on, as the breeze
played with her white silk bonnet-strings and the wavy
little kinks of soft brown hair that framed her forehead,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>‘and I want you to move me to the upper floor
at once.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘You mean the promenade deck, madam,’ says I,
smoothing out a grin, though I’m well enough used to
the odd bungles land-folks make over names of things
at sea.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The flying pencil stopped. The Pressman looked up,
turning his shortened cigar between his teeth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When do we come to the elephant?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’re at him now,” said the Second Officer. “‘You
mean the promenade deck,’ says I. ‘Does your patient
occupy one of the cabins on the port or the starboard
side, and may I ask his number and name?’ Then she
smiled at me brightly, her eyes and teeth making a sort
of flash together. ‘He doesn’t have a cabin,’ says she;
‘he sleeps in a cage. My patient is Bingo, the elephant!’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Great Pierpont Morgan!” ejaculated the Pressman.
His previously flying pencil became almost invisible
from the extreme rapidity with which he plied it. Drops
of perspiration broke out upon his sallow forehead.
“Glory!” he cried. “And not another man thought it
worth while to run out and tackle this wallowing old
tub but me!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I touched my cap,” went on the Second Officer,
“keeping down as professionally as I could the surprise
I felt.... ‘Do I understand, madam,’ I asked,
‘that you are the elephant’s nurse?’ And at that she
nodded with another bright smile, and told me that
she was Nurse Amy, of St. Baalam’s Nursing Association,
London, specially engaged by the American gentleman
who had bought the elephant——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Shadland C. McOster,” prompted the Pressman,
without looking up.</p>

<p class='c009'>“To attend to the animal on the voyage. It was understood
that if the principal patient’s condition permitted,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>Nurse Amy was to pay the leopards such attentions
as they were capable of appreciating, but there
was no pressure on this point.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ohowgh!” coughed the voice outside. “Yarr!
Ohowgh!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He smells the land, I guess,” said the Pressman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Or the niggers,” suggested the Second Officer.
“You ought to have heard Bingo when we were three
days out from the Mersey.... We’d had a fair wind
and a smooth sea at first, and nothing delighted the
ladies and children on board like feeding him with apples,
and nuts, and biscuits, and things prigged from
the saloon tables. The sea-air must have sharpened the
beast’s appetite, I suppose, for that old trunk of his
was snorking round all day, and the Purser, who was
naturally wild about it, said he must have put away
hogsheads of good things in addition to his allowance of
hay, and bread, and beetroot, and grain, and cabbages,
and sugar——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Was he ca’am in temper?” asked the Pressman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mild as milk.... As kind a beast as ever
breathed; and elephants do a lot of breathing,” said the
Second Officer. “The ladies and gentlemen in the upper-deck
cabins used to complain about his snoring in
the night; but as Nurse Amy said, there are people
who’d complain about anything. And some of ’em
didn’t like the smell of elephant—which, I’ll allow, when
you happened to get to wind’ard of Bingo, was—phew!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pooty vociferous?” hinted the Pressman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Until,” went on the Second Officer, “Nurse Amy
took to washing him with scented soap.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The pencil stopped. The Pressman looked up with
circular eyes. “Scented——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Soap,” said the Second Officer. “No expense was
to be spared—and we’d several cases of a special toilet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>and complexion article on board. By the living Harry!
if you’d seen that elephant standing up over his morning
tub of hot water, swabbing away at himself with
a deck-sponge Nurse Amy had soaped for him, and then
squirting the water over himself to rinse off the soap,
you’d have believed in the intelligence of animals. The
sight drew like a pantomime.... But by the sixth
day out Bingo had given up all interest in his own appearance.
The weather was squally, a bit of a sea got
up, hardly a passenger put in an appearance at the
saloon tables, and Bingo only shook his ears when the
bugle blew, and turned away from his morning haystack
and mound of cabbages with disgust. Nurse Amy
got him to eat some biscuits and drink a bucket of
Bovril, but you could see he was only doing it to oblige
her. ‘Oh, come, cheer up!’ she said in a brisk, professional
way. ‘You’ll get your sea-legs on directly and
the officer says we’re having a wonderfully smooth passage,
considering the time of the year.’ But Bingo only
sighed, and two tears trickled out of his little red eyes,
as he swayed from side to side. ‘He’ll be worse before
he’s better,’ says I; for somehow I was generally about
when Nurse Amy was looking after her big charge.
‘He’ll be worse before he’s better,’ <em>and he was</em>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Pressman’s face was streaked and shiny, his hair
lay glued to his brow. The pencil went on, devouring
page after page.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nurse Amy, luckily for her patient, was not upset
by the pitching of the vessel, for it blew half a gale
steady from the sou’-west, and the old <em>Centipede</em> dipped
her nose pretty frequently. Nurse was as busy as a
bee endeavoring by every means she could devise or
adopt from the suggestions of the stewardesses, who
showed a good deal of interest in her and her charge,
to alleviate the sufferings of Bingo. I have seen that
little woman stand for an hour on the wet planking,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>holding a six-foot deck-swab soaked with eau-de-Cologne
to Bingo’s forehead....”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Pressman jotted down, breathing heavily. “Deck-swab
soaked in eau-de-Cologne....” he muttered.
“Must have cost slathers of money, I reckon——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No expense was to be spared,” the Second Officer
reminded him gently. “As for the brandy, Martell’s
Three Star, he must have put away a dozen bottles a
day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No blamed wonder his head ached!” said the Pressman,
moistening his own dry lips.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Except an occasional bucket of arrowroot with port
wine and a tin or so of cuddy biscuits, the animal would
take no other nourishment whatever,” continued the
Second Officer. “As he grew weaker and weaker, it
was touching to see the way in which he clung to Nurse
Amy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Clung to her?” the Pressman wrote, marking the
words for a headline.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fact,” said the Second Officer. “He would put his
trunk round her waist, and lay his head on her shoulder
as she stood on a ladder lashed against the side of his
cage. And he would hang out his forefoot to have his
pulse felt, quite in a Christian style. Then when Nurse
Amy wanted to take his temperature, the docile brute
would curl up his fire-hose—I mean his trunk—and open
his mouth, so that the instrument might be comfortably
placed under his tongue.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“By gings, sir, this story is going to knock corners
off creation!” gasped the Pressman, pausing to wipe
his face with a slightly smeary cuff. “An elephant that
understood the use of the therm—blame it! that beast
robbed some man of a fortune when he passed in his
checks!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We lost so many of the ordinary kind of instrument
in this way,” went on the Second Officer, almost pensively,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>“that at last Nurse Amy was obliged to fall back
upon the large thermometer and barometer combined
that usually hung in the first saloon. But it recorded,
to our sorrow, no improvement. The mercury steadily
sank, and it became plain to Nurse Amy’s professional
eye that her patient was not long for this world.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Say, do you believe elephants have souls?” queried
the Pressman. The Second Officer deigned no reply.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She could not leave him a moment; he trumpeted
so awfully when he saw her quit his side. I forgot to
tell you that from the moment he first felt himself
attacked by sea-sickness his bellows of rage and agony
were frightful to hear. The other animals became excited
by them; they roared and snarled without cessation.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Raised general hell,” said the Pressman, “with trimmings.”
But he wrote down with a sign that meant
leaded spaces and giant capitals:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>“PANDEMONIUM IN MID-OCEAN!”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“Nobody on board got a wink of sleep,” said the
Second Officer—“that is, unless the devoted Nurse Amy
was by the sufferer’s side. Towards the end, when, exhausted
by days and nights of arduous nursing, the
devoted girl had retired to her deck-cabin to snatch a
few moments of much-needed rest, the entire crew vied
with each other in efforts to pacify Bingo, without the
slightest effect. When they tried to put his feet in hot
water he mashed the ship’s buckets like so many gooseberries,
and shot the Purser down with half a trunkful
of hot cocoa, which had been offered as a last resource.
But on Nurse Amy’s appearing he grew pacified, and
from that moment until the end the heroic woman never
left his side. I begged her to consider herself and those
dear to her,” said the Second Officer, with a little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>tremble in his voice, “but she only smiled—a worn kind
of smile—and said that duty must be considered first.
I won’t deny it,” said the Second Officer, openly producing
a very white pocket-handkerchief and unfolding
it. “I kissed that woman’s hand as though she had been
the Queen.” He concealed his face with the handkerchief
and coughed rather loudly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Rude Shellback Touched to the Quick,” wrote
the Pressman. “He Sheds Tears.” “Get on with the
death-scene, sir, if you don’t object!” he said, breathing
through his nose excitedly. “If that elephant asked
for a minister, I’d not be surprised!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He did make his will, after a fashion,” said the narrator.
“You see, during the convulsive struggles I have
described, when he broke off his right tusk—didn’t I
mention that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No!” denied the Pressman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He broke it, anyhow, right off short, as a boy might
snap a carrot,” said the Second Officer. “There it lay,
among the litter, in the bottom of his cage. He had
suddenly ceased trumpeting, and a deathly silence had
fallen on all creation, one would have said. The vessel
still rolled a bit, but the wind had fallen, and the sun
was going down like a blot of fire, on the——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Western horizon,” wrote the Pressman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nurse Amy, from her ladder, still rendered the last
offices of human kindness to the sinking animal, sponging
his forehead with ice-water and fanning him with
a bellows. As she whispered to me that the end was
near, Bingo opened his eyes. With an expiring effort
he lifted the broken tusk from the bottom of the cage,
dropped it on the deck at his faithful Nurse’s feet,
uttered a heavy groan, threw up his trunk, sank gently
forward upon his massive knees, and died!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The editor of the opposition paper will do another
die when he runs his eye over the <em>Yeller</em> to-morrow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>morning,” said the Pressman, joyfully smacking the
rubber band round the filled notebook. “And the port-rail
got carried away when you yanked the body overboard?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We couldn’t stuff him,” said the Second Officer
with a sigh. “As for preserving him in spirits, we
hadn’t enough spirits left to think of it. We rigged
a special derrick, and heaved Bingo overboard, carrying
away, as you have guessed, the port-rail in the
operation. As Bingo’s tremendous carcass rose and
floated buoyantly away to leeward, back and head well
above the water, and the two great ears resting flat
upon the surface like gigantic lily-pads, Nurse Amy
uttered a faint cry and swooned in my arms.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Some folks get all the luck!” commented the Pressman,
who, having filled his book, was now jotting down
notes upon his left cuff.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ve not much to complain of, it strikes me!”
observed the Second Officer, with a glance at the
crammed notebook.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I guess that’s true!” said the Pressman, with a
sigh of satisfaction. “Now, all I want is a photograph
or a sketch of that splendid heroine of a girl, and the
honor of shaking her hand, and telling her she deserves
to be an American—and I’d not trade places with the
President.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Second Officer appeared to be struggling with
some emotion. The muscles of his mouth worked violently.
He reddened through the red, and suspicious moisture
shone in his eyes. One by one the members of the
silent but not unappreciative audience of male passengers
that had gradually gathered within earshot of the
Second Officer and his victim, manifested the same symptoms.
And glancing for the first time at those listening
faces, and observing the identical expression stamped
upon each, the Pressman, encircled by wet, crinkled eyes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>and cheerfully-curled-back lips, fringed with teeth in all
stages of preservation, grasped the conviction that he
had been had. And at this crucial moment the hatch-door
of the smoke-room rolled back in its brass coamings,
and a pointed gray beard and kindly keen eyes,
sheltered by the peak of a gold-laced cap, appeared
in the aperture.</p>

<p class='c009'>“New York Harbor, gentlemen,” said the Captain
genially. “We’re running into the docks now, and the
Custom House officers will board us directly.... I
shouldn’t wonder,” he continued, as the majority of the
occupants of the smoke-room one by one glided away,
“if the newspapers made a story out of our missing port-rail!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Permit me to introduce myself as a reporter of the
<cite>N’York Yeller</cite>,” said the young gentleman in tweeds,
as he rose and touched his hat. “Perhaps, sir, you
would favor me with the facts in connection with the
occurrence?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Haven’t you had it from Murchison? Why, Murchison——”
the Captain was beginning, when with a
choking snort the Second Officer rushed from the smoke-room.
“Though there’s nothing to tell, Mr. Reporter,
worth hearing. A derrick-chain broke at Southampton
Docks, and a case of agricultural machine-parts did the
damage. We temporarily repaired with some iron piping,
and a length of wire hawser; but, of course, it
shows badly, and suggests——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A collision!” said a smiling stranger.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Or an elephant,” said another.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yarr!” proclaimed the horrible voice outside.
“Ohowgh! Yarr!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I understand,” said the Pressman with an effort,
“that the elephant emanated from the teeming brain
of Mr. Murchison. But the leopard—there is a leopard,
I surmise, if hearing goes for evidence?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>The Captain’s excellent teeth showed under his gray
mustache. “That noise, you mean?” he exclaimed....
“Oh, that’s one of our electric air-pumps, for forcing
air into the lower-deck storage chambers, you know.
She’s out of gear, and lets us know it in that way. Must
have her seen to at New York. Take a drink, won’t you?
Come, gentlemen, order what you please.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Whisky, square,” murmured the Pressman, as the
long, smooth glide of the liner was checked, the engines
throbbed and stopped, and the dull roar of the docks
pressed upon listening ears. He drank, and as the fluid
traversed the usual channel, his eye grew brighter....
“Say, Captain,” he asked, “do you know where your
Second Officer was raised?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Murchison comes, I believe, from Yorkshire,” said
the Captain. “Hey, Murchison, isn’t that the place?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am not acquainted with the geology of Yorkshire,”
observed the Pressman, as he passed the Second Officer
on his way to the smoke-room; “but the soil grows good
liars! So long!”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>GEMINI<br /> <span class='large'>AN EMBARRASSMENT OF CHOICE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>To Captain Galahad Ranking, grilling over his Musketry-Instructorship
at Hounslow one arid July, came
a square lilac envelope, addressed in a sprawling hand,
with plenty of violet ink. The missive smelt of Rhine
violets. It bore a monogram, the initials “L. K.” fantastically
intertwined, and was, in fact, an invitation
from his affectionate cousin Laura, dated from a pleasant
country mansion situate amid green lawns and blushing
rose-gardens on the Werkshire reaches of the Thames.</p>

<p class='c009'>Laura was not Galahad’s cousin by blood, but by marriage.
Laura was the still young and attractive widow
of Thomson Kingdom, once a stout man on the Stock
Exchange, remarkable for a head of very upright gray
hair and a startling taste in printed linen. Pigs and
peaches were his pet hobbies, and the apoplectic seizure
from which he never rallied was induced by a weakness
in “the City” caused by unprecedentedly heavy selling-orders
from a nervous north-eastern European capital,
about the time of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entente cordiale</span></i>. So the bloom
was barely off Laura’s crêpe, and the new black gloves
purchased by Galahad to grace his kinsman’s obsequies
had not done duty at another funeral. The scrawly
postscript to her letter said: “I want to consult you
<em>very particularly</em>, in the <em>most absolute confidence</em>, upon
a matter affecting my <em>whole future</em>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Galahad Ranking, Junior Captain, Fourth Battalion
Royal Deershire Regiment, wrinkled up his freckled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>little countenance into queer puckers, and rubbed his
bristly cinnamon-colored hair, already getting thin on
the summit of his skull, as he puzzled the brain within
that receptacle as to the possible meaning of Laura’s
impassioned appeal. He was a small man, whose demure
and spinster-like demeanor led new acquaintances
to ask him plumply how on earth he had managed to
get his D.S.O.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There were chances,” he would reply to these querists,
“to be had out there,” waving his hand vaguely
in the direction of South Africa, “and I saw one of
them and took it—that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Others might pump him more successfully to the
effect that he—Galahad Ranking—was a poor devil of
a militiaman attached to the Royal Deershires; that a
small detachment of that well-known territorial regiment,
garrisoned in a beastly small tin-pot fort on the
Springbok River, Eastern Transvaal, were by Boers besieged;
that relief was urgently necessary; and that
“one of the fellows went and brought up Kitchener.”
Said fellow admitted upon further cross-examination to
have been himself. But for such details as that the
bringing up involved a six-mile run in scorching sun
over tangled bush veldt, crossing the enemy’s lines, being
sniped at by Boer sharpshooters and chased by Boer
pickets, the curious must refer to despatches. Stampeding
Army mules would not trample the truth out
of the man.</p>

<p class='c009'>He wrung half-hearted leave of absence from the
powers that were, and his orderly packed the battered
tin suit-case and the Gladstone bag that had spent three
days at the bottom of a water-hole, and, having had its
numerous labels soaked off, bore a painfully leprous
appearance.</p>

<p class='c009'>He found Laura’s omnibus automobile, with its luggage
tender, waiting at Cholsford Junction, and smiled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>his dry little smile, mentally comparing the dimensions
of the vehicle with the size of the guest. The suit-case
and the Gladstone bag made a poor show; but there
were other things to come: huge packages from the
Stores, and a sea-weedy hamper from Great Fishby, and
some cases of champagne with the label of a first-class
Regent Street firm. “Poor Kingdom’s wine-merchants!”
Ranking said to himself, and he blinked in a bewildered
way at a bandbox of mammoth proportions and
three dressmakers’ boxes of stout cardboard with tin
corners, their covers bearing the flourishing signature
of Babin <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">et Cie</span></i>. Because, you know, Laura’s bereavement
was so very recent, and bachelors of Galahad’s
type have a somewhat exaggerated notion of the extent
to which conjugal mourners are expected to bewail themselves.
However, even a widow requires clothes. This
handsome concession to feminine idiosyncrasy made,
Galahad ousted Laura’s chauffeur from the driving-seat,
and, assuming the steering-wheel, was reaching for the
starting-lever when the chauffeur stopped him with—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Beg pardon, sir, but there’s a gentleman to fetch.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A visitor to The Rodelands?” Galahad asked, with
furrows of surprise forming below his hat-brim.</p>

<p class='c009'>The mechanic, a gloomy young man in a gold-banded
cap, with a weakness for wearing waterproofs in the
driest weather, replied, without a groom’s alertness or
a groom’s civility:</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s a gentleman staying at Eyot Cottage....”
Adding, as Galahad faintly recalled the creeper-covered
cot in question, modestly perched on the edge of a
marshy lawn running down to the river, and usually
let by the landlord of the local hotel to honeymooning
couples: “And we usually give him a lift.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As the chauffeur spoke, the gentleman emerged from
the dim, echoing archway through which the down platform
disgorged. The stranger was young—Galahad,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>who was middle-aged, saw that at a glance—and fair,
while Galahad was sandy. He wore a suit of gray
tweeds too short in the sleeves and trouser-legs, and his
cherubically pink countenance, adorned with large,
round, china-blue eyes and a little flaxen mustache, was
carried at an altitude which would have been disconcerting
to a Lifeguardsman of six feet high, and was
simply maddening to Galahad, who could only be categorized
as small. We are all human, and Galahad was
secretly gratified to observe that the young giant’s
shoulders boasted a graceful droop, and that his chest
was somewhat narrow.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hullo, Watson!” observed the tall young gentleman,
condescendingly; and Watson smiled faintly and actually
touched his cap as the new-comer favored Galahad
with a long and round-eyed stare.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I believe you are coming with us?” said Galahad,
raising his hat with punctilious politeness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not inside, thanks,” was the long-legged young
stranger’s reply. He stared harder than ever, and
Watson murmured in Galahad’s ear that the gentleman
usually drove.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Does he?” ejaculated the astonished Galahad.</p>

<p class='c009'>A man may hold the rank of captain in one of his
Majesty’s territorial Regiments, and yet be shy; may
have earned the right to adorn his thorax with the D.S.O.,
and yet be bashful; may be a more than efficient instructor
in Musketry, and yet shrink from the gratuitous
schooling of underbred youth in the amenities of good
breeding. In less time than it takes to relate it, Galahad
was stowed in the omnibus body of the “Runhard”
where, a very little kernel in a very roomy shell, he
rattled about as the familiar landscape reeled giddily
by at the will and pleasure of the long-legged young
gentleman, who might be described as the kind of
driver that takes risks. A peculiarly steep and curving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>hill announced by signboards lettered, in appropriate
crimson, “Dangerous!” afforded facilities for the exercise
of his peculiar talent which temporarily deprived
the inside passenger of breath.</p>

<p class='c009'>The river lay at the bottom of the hill, and the dwelling
of Mrs. Kingdom, described in the local guide as
“an elegant riparian villa,” sat in its green meadows
and sunny croquet lawns and rose-trellised gardens,
on the other side.</p>

<p class='c009'>The automobile swirled in at the lodge-gates, stopped,
and Galahad got out, welcomed by the joyful barking
of Dinmonts, fox-terriers, pugs, and poodles.</p>

<p class='c009'>Knee-deep in dogs, the little man responded to the
respectful greeting of Laura’s butler, a meek, gray-faced,
little, elderly personage with a frill of white whiskers
akin to the hirsute adornments of the rare variety
of the howling ape. Then the drawing-room door swung
open, letting out an avalanche of Pomeranians and
some Persian cats; Laura rose from a sofa and advanced
with a gushful greeting. Her outstretched hands were
grasped by Galahad; he was tinglingly conscious that
her widow’s weeds were eminently becoming.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dear Captain Ranking, how sweet of you to run
down!” Laura cooed. The flash of admiration in Galahad’s
weary gray eyes gave her sugared assurance that
she was looking her best; his ardent squeeze confirmed
the look.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You used to call me by my Christian name,” he
was saying, with a little undulating wobble of sentiment
in his voice. Then his glance went past Mrs. Kingdom,
and his lean under-jaw dropped. The long-legged gentleman
in gray tweed, who had driven, or rather hustled,
him from the station, was sitting on the sofa in a suit
of blue serge. No, Galahad was not mistaken. There
were the long legs, the champagne-bottle shoulders, the
china-blue eyes, and the little flaxen mustache. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>did not look so pink, that was all. And when Laura,
with a nervous giggle, introduced him as Mr. Lasher,
he began getting up from the sofa as though he never
would have done.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How do?” he said, when his yellow head had soared
to the ceiling.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Met you before,” said Galahad with some terseness.
“And you frightened me abominably by the way you
scorched down Penniford Hill.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The long-legged young man stared with circular blue
eyes. Laura burst into a peal of rippling laughter,
which struck Galahad as being forced and beside the
point.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear Galahad,” Mrs. Kingdom cried, “you must
have met Brosy! This is Dosy,” she added, as though
all were now clear, and welcomed with a perfect <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">feu de
joie</span></i> of giggles the entrance of the veritable and original
young man in gray tweeds who had driven the automobile,
and now came strolling into the drawing-room.
Then she introduced the pair formally to Captain Ranking
as Mr. Theodosius and Mr. Ambrose Lasher, and
rustled away to pour out tea, leaving Galahad in a jaundiced
frame of mind. For one thing, he hated to be
mystified; for another, being an ordinary, though heroic,
human being, he had taken at the first moment
of encounter a singularly ardent and sincere dislike to
the “long-legged, blue-eyed young bounder,” as he mentally
termed Mr. Brosy Lasher; and the discovery that
the object of his loathing existed in duplicate was not
a welcome one. He was dry, stiff, and jerky in his
responses to the loud and patronizing advances of the
two Lashers. Fortunately the twin young gentlemen
accepted as admiration, what was, in fact, the opposite
sentiment. They had been used to a good deal of this
since the first moment of their simultaneous entrance
upon this mundane stage, and they were twenty-six.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>“It is so sad,” Laura said in confidential aside to
Galahad. “They have lost both parents, and have
hardly a penny in the world.” She raised and crumpled
her still pretty eyebrows with the old infantile air of
appeal. “Two such delightful boys, and so handsome!
... though to my eye Brosy’s nose is less purely Greek
in outline than Dosy’s. And they were educated at a
public school, with every advantage that a rich man’s
sons might naturally expect. But, of course, you recognized
the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cachet</span></i> of Eton at once?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I notice,” said Ranking drily, “that they both leave
the lower button of their waistcoats undone, and call
men whom they don’t like ‘scugs.’” His quiet eye
dwelt with dubious tenderness upon the Messrs. Lasher,
who were romping with the dogs upon the sofas, and
devouring cake and strawberries with infantile greed.
“I have heard of the Eton manner, of course,” he added,
“and I meet a good many Eton-bred men; but I can’t
say that these young fellows have any—any special characteristics
in common with—ah—those.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They belong to a grand old family,” Laura continued,
with an air of proprietorship that puzzled Galahad.
“The Lashers of Dropshire, you know—quite historical.
And their father ran through everything before
they came of age. So thoughtless, wasn’t it? And
now they are looking round for an opening in life, and
really, they tell me, it is dreadfully difficult to find.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I rather imagined as much,” said Galahad, making
a little point of sarcasm all to himself, and secretly
smiling over it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wonder if you could suggest anything; you are
always so helpful,” Laura went on. “That they must
be together, of course, goes without saying. And that,
of course, increases the difficulty. But nobody could
be so inhuman as to part twins.” Her lips quivered, and
her eyes grew misty with unshed tears.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>“My dear Laura,” expostulated the puzzled Galahad,
“you talk as though these two young men were six
years old instead of six-and-twenty.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How changed you are!” Laura blinked away a tear.
“You used to understand me so much better in the old
days. <em>Of course</em>, they are grown up, that is plain to
the meanest capacity. But they have such boyish, charming,
confiding natures.... Toto will bite, Brosy, if
you hold him in the air by the tail!... that a woman
like myself.... If you would like some more cherry
cake, Dosy, do ring the bell!... a woman like myself,
married at eighteen to a man true and noble if you will,
but incapable of awakening the deeper chords of passion
and.... Of course, you are both going to dine
here and help me to entertain Captain Ranking!...
denied the happiness of being a mother”—Laura
drooped her eyes and bit her lip, and blushed slightly—“must
naturally find their company a <em>great resource</em>.
And the distant cousin with whom they are staying,
a Mrs. Le Bacon Chalmers, who has taken Eyot Cottage
for the summer months, <em>knows this</em> and <em>lends</em> them to
me as <em>often</em> as I like.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Upon my word, she is uncommonly kind!” said
Galahad, with emphasis stronger than Laura’s italics.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, isn’t she?” responded Laura, whose sense of
humor was obscured by predilection. “They ride and
drive the horses, and give Holt and the gardeners advice,
and they exercise the automobiles, and run the
electric launch about, and play tennis and croquet——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And the devil generally!” were the words that Galahad
bit off and gulped down.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was very quiet at dinner, sitting in the deceased
Kingdom’s place at the foot of the table. And Dosy
and Brosy were very loud and very large, though looking,
it must be confessed, exceedingly well in evening
garb. They made themselves very much at home upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>Laura’s right and left hand, recommending certain
dishes to each other, criticizing more, ravaging the bonbons,
reveling in the dessert, calling, with artless airs
of connoisseurship, for special wines laid down by the
noble man who yet had not known how to awaken
the deeper chords of passion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gad! what a pair of hawbucks!” Galahad mentally
ejaculated as the servants ran about like distracted ants,
and Laura and Laura’s inseparable though elderly companion-friend,
Miss Glidding, vied with each other in
encouraging Theodosius and Ambrose to renewed attacks
upon the strawberries and peaches.</p>

<p class='c009'>Left alone with Dosy and Brosy, he submitted to be
patronized, offered cigars he had chosen, recommended
to try liqueurs with whose liverish and headachy qualities
he had been acquainted of old.</p>

<p class='c009'>They walked with the ladies in the dewy rose-gardens
after dinner, and as Galahad paused to light a cigar,
behold, he was left alone. Laura with Brosy, Miss Glidding
(who looked her best by bat-light) with Dosy, had
vanished in the shadowy windings of the trellis-walks
and arcades. And Captain Ranking, shrugging his shoulders,
picked a half-seen Niphetos, glimmering among the
wet, shining leaves, and walked back to the smoking-room,
wondering why on earth Laura had dragged him
down where he seemed least to be wanted. What was
the matter “affecting her whole future” upon which
she required advice? His heart gave a sickening little
jog as he realized that the future of Dosy, or possibly
of Brosy, might also be involved. True, Laura was
thirty-nine; but what are years when the heart is young?
Galahad asked himself, as peal after peal of the widow’s
laughter broke the silence of the scented night. Other
mental interrogations fretted his aching brain. What
must the servants not have thought and said? What
would the neighbors say? What would the County think
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>of such sportive, not to say frivolous, conduct on the
part of a widow but recently emancipated from weepers,
whose handkerchiefs were still bordered with the inch-deep
inky deposit of conjugal woe?</p>

<p class='c009'>Kingdom was an easy-going, level-headed man, Galahad
admitted, biting at one of the deceased’s Havanas
and frowning; “but he would have raised the Devil
over this. Possibly he’s doing it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The portrait of Mr. Kingdom over the mantelshelf
of the smoking-room seemed to scowl confirmatively.
The servants were all in bed, the promenaders in the
garden showed no signs of returning. Galahad shrugged
his little shoulders, and went away to bed in a charming,
drum-windowed, chintz-hung bower over the front porch.
And just as his little cropped head plumped down on
the pillow it was electrically jolted up again. Laura
was saying good-night in the porch to one—or was it
both?—of the infernal twins. And before the hall-door
clashed they had promised to come over to lunch to-morrow.
Confound them! it was to-morrow now.</p>

<p class='c009'>One has only to add that when, after exhausting
watches, slumber visited Galahad’s eyelids, the twins
in maddening iteration played dominoes throughout his
dreams, to convince the reader that they had thoroughly
got upon his nerves.</p>

<p class='c009'>Laura, looking wonderfully fresh and young in a lace
morning <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">négligé</span></i> of the peek-a-boo description, poured
out his coffee at breakfast and sympathized with him
about the headache he denied. Then, shaded by a fluffy
black-and-white sunshade, the widow led Galahad out
into the sunny garden to a tree-shaded and sequestered
nook where West Indian hammocks hung, and, installing
herself in one of these receptacles, invited her husband’s
cousin to repose himself in another.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lying on your back, counting ripening plums dangling
from green branches above, oscillating at the bidding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>of the lightest breeze, liable to upset at the slightest
movement, it is difficult to be indignant and sarcastic;
but Galahad was both.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Adopt these young men as sons, my dear Laura!
Are there no parentless babies in the local workhouse
that would better supply the need you express of having
something to cherish and love?” exclaimed Galahad.</p>

<p class='c009'>He sat up with an effort and stared at Laura. Laura
rocked, prone amid cushions, knitting a silk necktie of
a tender hue suited to a blonde complexion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Workhouse babies are invariably ugly, and unhealthy
into the bargain,” she pouted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Some orphan child from a Home, that is pretty to
look at and has had the distemper properly,” suggested
Galahad.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t want an orphan from a Home,” objected
Laura. “Besides, it wouldn’t be a twin.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There are such things as twin orphans, my dear
Laura,” protested Galahad.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Laura was firm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dosy and Brosy are very, very dear to me,” she
protested, a little pinkness about the eyelids and nostrils
threatening an impending tear-shower. “They came
into my life,” she continued poetically, “at a time of
sorrow and bereavement, and the sunshine of their presence
drove the dark clouds away. Of course, they are
too old, or, rather, not young enough, to be really my
sons,” she continued, “but they might have been poor
Tom’s.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If poor Tom had fathered a brace of bounders like
those,” burst out Galahad, “poor Tom would have kicked
himself—that’s all I know—kicked himself!” he repeated,
fuming and climbing out of his hammock.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pray don’t be coarse,” entreated Laura—“and abusive,”
she added, as an afterthought. “Of course, as
poor Tom’s trustee and executor, I am bound to make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>a show of consulting you, though my mind is really
made up, and nobody can prevent my doing what I like
with my own income. I shall allow the boys five hundred
a year each for pocket money,” she added with
a pretty maternal air. “And Dosy shall go into the
Diplomatic Service, and Brosy——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You have broached the adoption plan to them then?”
gasped Galahad. Laura bowed her head. “And this
relative with whom I gather they are now staying,” he
continued, “is she agreeable to the proposed arrangement?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mrs. Le Bacon Chalmers? She couldn’t prevent it
if she wasn’t!” retorted Laura, “as the boys are of age.
But, as it happens, she thinks the plan an ideal one.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That proves the value of her judgment, certainly.
And the County? Will your friends and neighbors also
think the plan an ideal one?” demanded Galahad.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My friends and neighbors,” said Laura, loftily,
“will think as I do, or they will cease to be my friends.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Galahad, usually punctiliously well-mannered, whistled
long and dismally. “Phew! And when you have alienated
every soul upon your visiting list, what will you
do for society?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall have the boys,” said Laura, with defiant tenderness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And when the ‘boys,’ as you call them, marry?” insinuated
Galahad.</p>

<p class='c009'>Laura sat up so suddenly that all her cushions rolled
out of the hammock. “If this is how you treat me when
I turn to you for advice——” she began.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Laura,” said Galahad firmly, “you don’t want advice.”
He held up his lean brown hand and checked
her, as she would have spoken. “Nor do you require
twin sons of six feet three. What you want is——”
He was going in his innocence to say “a sincere and
candid friend,” and prove himself the ideal by some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>plain speaking, but Laura fairly brimmed over with
conscious blushes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How—how can you?” she said, in vibrating tones
of reproach, devoid of even a shade of anger. “So soon,
too! As if I did not know what was due to poor
Tom——”</p>

<p class='c009'>The toot of a motor-horn, the scuffle of the engine,
the dry whirr of the brake as the locomotive stopped
at the avenue gate, broke in upon her heroics.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here are the boys,” she cried rapturously, and, indeed,
hopped out of the hammock with the agility of
girlhood as the long-legged, yellow-haired twins came
stalking over the grass. She held out her hands to them
with a pretty maternal gesture.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dosy pet, Brosy darling,” she babbled, “come and
kiss Mummy! We have been telling all our little plans
to Uncle Galahad, and Uncle quite agrees.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No! Does he, though?” was the simultaneous utterance
of the long-legged twins. They twirled their yellow
mustaches, stooped awkwardly and “kissed
Mummy,” as Galahad uttered a yell of frenzied laughter,
and, throwing himself recklessly into his recently-vacated
hammock, shot out upon the other side.</p>

<p class='c009'>He went back to Hounslow that day. Dosy and Brosy
dutifully accompanied him to the station, and exchanged
a fraternal wink when his train steamed out.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What an infatuation!” he groaned. In his mind’s
eye he saw the County grinning over the childless widow
and her adopted twins. As for Dosy and Brosy, they
would have what in America is termed “a soft
snap.” Powerful jaws had both the young gentlemen,
wide and greedy gullets. Still, with his mind’s eye
Galahad saw their foolish, affectionate, sentimental benefactress
gnawed to the bare bone. Day by day he anticipated
a letter of shrill astonishment from his cotrustee,
and when it came, hinting at mental weakness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>and the necessity of restraint, he flamed up into defense
of Laura so hotly as to surprise himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>And then, before anything decisive had been done
with regard to the settlement—before Brosy and Dosy
had taken up their quarters for good beneath the roof
of their adopted parent—a change befell, and Galahad
received an imploring note from Mrs. Kingdom soliciting
his instant presence upon “an urgent matter.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She has thought better of it,” said Galahad to himself,
as he obeyed the summons. “Her native good
sense”—you will realize that the man must have been
genuinely in love to believe in Laura’s native good
sense—“has come to her aid!” And in his mind’s eye
he beheld the long, narrow backs of the twins walking
away into a dim perspective.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was September. Dosy and Brosy were shooting the
widow’s partridges, and Galahad found her alone. She
was pleased and excited, with an air of one who with
difficulty keeps the cork in a bottle of mystery; and when
she clasped her hands round Galahad’s arm and told him
what a true, true friend he was! he felt absurdly tender,
as he begged her to confide her trouble to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have made such a dreadful discovery,” Laura
gasped, dabbing her eyes with a filmy little square of
cambric edged with the narrowest possible line of black,
“about the—about the boys.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Galahad strove to compose his features into an expression
of decent regret.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr. Ambrose and Mr. Theodosius Lasher.... I
rather anticipated that you—that possibly there were
discoveries to be made.” He turned his weary gray eyes
upon Laura, and pulled at one wiry end of his little
gingery mustache. “Have they done anything very
bad?” he asked, and his tone was not uncheerful.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bad!” echoed Laura, with indignant scorn. “As
though two young men gifted with natures like theirs”—she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>had left off calling them “boys,” Galahad noticed—“so
lofty, so noble, so unselfish—and yes, I will
say it, so pure!—could possibly be guilty of any bad or
even doubtful action. But you do not know them, and
you are prejudiced; you must admit you are prejudiced
when you hear the—the truth.” The cork escaped, and
the secret came with it in a gush. “It is this: I cannot
be a mother to Dosy and Brosy; they, poor dears, cannot
be my sons. I had not the least idea of their true feeling
with regard to me, nor had they, until quite recently.”
She swallowed a little sob and dabbed her eyes
again. “Oh, Galahad, they are madly in love with me,
both of them. What, what am I to do?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Send them to the devil, the impudent young beggars!”
snorted Galahad. And, striding up and down
between the trembling china-tables with clenched fists
and angry eyes, he said all the things he had longed to
say about folly, and madness and infatuation.</p>

<p class='c009'>A woman will always submit with a good grace to
masculine upbraiding when she has reason to believe
the upbraider jealous. Laura bore his reproaches with
saintly sweetness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They have behaved in the most honorable way, poor
darlings!” she protested, “though the realization of the
true nature of their feelings towards me, of course, came
as a terrible shock. The deeds of settlement had been
drawn up. We planned, as soon as everything had been
sealed and signed, that the dear boys were to come and
live here. I had furnished their bedrooms exactly alike,
and fitted up the smoking-room with twin armchairs,
twin tobacco-tables, and so on, when the blow fell.” She
deepened her voice to a thrilling whisper. “Dosy, looking
quite pale and tragic, asked for an interview in the
conservatory; Brosy begged for a private word in the
pavilion at the end of the upper croquet-lawn. And
then,” said Laura, shedding abundant tears, “I knew
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>what I had done. It did occur to me that I might—might
marry Brosy and adopt Dosy as my son, or marry
Dosy and regard Brosy as an heir. But no, it could
not be. Dosy proposed to take poison, or shoot himself,
in the most unselfish way; and Brosy suggested going
in for a swim too soon after breakfast, and never rising
from a dive again. But neither could endure to live
to see me the bride of the other,” sobbed Laura.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And as this is England, and not Malabar,” uttered
Galahad, dryly, “the law is against your marrying
both.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, of course, my dear Galahad,” cried Laura innocently,
scandalized and round-eyed.</p>

<p class='c009'>The man who really loved her looked at her and forgave
her foolishness. She had set the County buzzing
with the tale of her absurd infatuation; she had compromised
her dignity by the tragic follies of the past
few months; there was but one way of gagging the
scandalmongers and regaining lost ground, one way of
getting out of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">impasse</span></i>. Galahad pointed out that
way, as Laura entreated him to suggest something.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why not marry me?” he said bluntly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Galahad!” cried Laura, bright-eyed and quite
pleasantly thrilled. “And then we can both adopt the
boys.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Whether they embrace that idea or not,” said Galahad,
with his arm round the long-coveted waist, “remains
to be seen. But I promise you, if occasion should
arise, that I will act as a father to them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He went out, in his new parental character, to look
for Dosy and Brosy and break the joyful news. His
freckled little face was beaming with smiles, his usually
weary gray eyes were alight; he smiled under his bristly
little mustache as he selected a stout but stinging
Malacca cane from the late Thompson Kingdom’s collection
in the hall....</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>A DISH OF MACARONI</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>On the occasion of the tenth biennial visit of the
Carlo Da Capo Grand Opera Combination to the musical,
if murky, city of Smutchester, the principal members
of the company pitched their tents, as was their
wont, at the Crown Diamonds Hotel, occupying an entire
floor of that capacious caravanserie, whose <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef</span></i>, to the
grief of many honest British stomachs and the unrestrained
joy of these artless children of song, was of
cosmopolitan gifts, being an Italian-Spanish-Swiss-German.
Here <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">prime donne</span></i>, tenors, and bassos could revel
in national dishes from which their palates had long
been divorced, and steaming masses of yellow polenta,
<em>knüdels</em>, and <em>borsch</em>, heaped dishes of sausages and red
cabbage, ragouts of cockscombs and chicken-livers, veal
stewed with tomatoes, frittura of artichokes, with other
culinary delicacies strange of aspect and garlicky as to
smell, loaded the common board at each meal, only to
vanish like the summer snow, so seldom seen but so
constantly referred to by the poetical fictionist, amidst
a Babel of conversation which might only find its parallel
in the parrot-house at the Zoo. Ringed hands
plunged into salad-bowls; the smoke of cigarettes went
up in the intervals between the courses; the meerschaum-colored
lager of Munich, the yellow beer of Bass, the
purple Chianti, or the vintage of Epernay brimmed the
glasses; and the coffee that crowned the banquet was
black and thick and bitter as the soul of a singer who
has witnessed the triumph of a rival.</p>

<p class='c009'>For singers can be jealous: and the advice of Dr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>Watts is more at discount behind the operatic scenes,
perhaps, than elsewhere. For women may be, and are,
jealous of other women; and men may be, and are, jealous
of men, off the stage; but it is reserved for the hero
and heroine of the stage to be jealous of one another.
The glare of the footlights, held by so many virtuous
persons to be inimical to the rosebud of innocence, has
a curiously wilting and shriveling effect upon the fine
flower of chivalry. Signor Alberto Fumaroli, <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">primo
uomo</span></i>, and possessor of a glorious tenor, was possessed
by the idea that the chief soprano, De Melzi, the enchanting
Teresa—still in the splendor of her youth, with
ebony tresses, eyes of jet, skin of ivory, an almost imperceptible
mustache, and a figure of the most seductive,
doomed ere long to expand into a pronounced
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">embonpoint</span></i>—had adorned her classic temples with laurels
which should by rights have decked his own. The
press-cuttings of the previous weeks certainly balanced
in her favor. Feeble-minded musical critics, of what
the indignant tenor termed “provincial rags,” lauded
the Signora to the skies. She was termed a “springing
fountain of crystal song,” a “human bulbul in the
rose-garden of melody.” Eulogy had exhausted itself
upon her; while he, Alberto Fumaroli, the admired of
empresses, master of the emotions of myriads of American
millionairesses, he was fobbed off with half a dozen
patronizing lines. Glancing over the paper in the saloon
carriage, he had seen the impertinent upper lip of
the De Melzi, tipped with the faintest line of shadow,
curl with delight as she scanned each accursed column
in turn, and handed the paper to her aunt (a vast person
invariably clad in the tightest and shiniest of black
satins, and crowned with a towering hat of violet velvet
adorned with once snowy plumes and crushed crimson
roses), who went everywhere with her niece, and mounted
guard over the exchequer. Outwardly calm as Vesuvius,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>and cool as a Neapolitan ice on a hot day, the outraged
Alberto endured the triumph of the women, marked
the subterranean chuckles of the stout Signora, the mischievous
enjoyment of Teresa; pulled his Austrian-Tyrolese
hat over his Corsican brows, and vowed a wily <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">vendetta</span></i>.
His opportunity for wreaking retribution would
come at Smutchester, he knew. Wagner was to be given
at the Opera House, and as great as the previous triumph
of Teresa de Melzi in the rôle of Elsa—newly
added by the soprano to her <em>repertoire</em>—should be her
fall. <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Evviva!</span></i> Down with that fatally fascinating face,
smiling so provokingly under its laurels! She should
taste the consequences of having insulted a Neapolitan.
And the tenor smiled so diabolically that Zamboni, the
basso, sarcastically inquired whether Fumaroli was rehearsing
<cite>Mephistofole</cite>?</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not so, dear friend,” Fumaroli responded, with a
dazzling show of ivories. “In that part I should make
a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bel fiasco</span></i>; I have no desire to emulate a basso or a
bull.... But in this—the rôle in which I am studying
to perfect myself—I predict that I shall achieve a
dazzling success.” He drew out a green Russia-leather
cigarette case, adorned with a monogram in diamonds.
“It is permitted that one smokes?” he added, and immediately
lighted up.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is permitted, if I am to have one also.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The De Melzi stretched a white, bejeweled hand out,
and the seething Alberto, under pain of appearing
openly impolite, was forced to comply. “No, I will not
take the cigarette you point out,” said the saucy <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">prima
donna</span></i>, as the tenor extended the open case. “It might
disagree with me, who knows? and I have predicted that
in the part of Elsa to-morrow night at Smutchester <em>I</em>
shall achieve a ‘dazzling success.’” And she smiled
with brilliant malice upon Alberto Fumaroli, who played
Lohengrin. “They are discriminating—the audiences of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>that big, black, melancholy place—they never mistake
geese for swans.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ach</span></i>, no!” said the Impresario, looking up from his
tatting—he was engaged upon a green silk purse for
Madame Da Capo, a wrinkled little doll of an old lady
with whom he was romantically in love. “They will
not take a <em>dournure</em>, some declamation, and half a
dozen notes in the upper register <em>bour dout botage</em>.
Sing to them well, they will be ready to give you their
heads. But sing to them badly, and they will be ready
to pelt yours. Twenty years ago they did. I remember
a graceless impostor, a <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">ragazzo</span></i> (foisted upon me
for a season by a villain of an agent), who annoyed them
in <em>Almaviva</em>.... <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ebbene</span></i>! the elections were in progress—there
was a <em>dimonstranza</em>. I can smell those antique
eggs, those decomposed oranges, now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Heart’s dearest, thou must not excite thyself,” interrupted
Madame; “it is so bad for thee. Play at the
poker-game, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mes enfants</span></i>,” she continued, “and leave
my good child, my beloved little one, alone!” Saying
this, Madame drew from her vast under-pocket a neat
case containing an ivory comb, and, removing the fearfully
and wonderfully braided traveling cap of the Impresario,
fell to combing his few remaining hairs until,
soothed by the process, Carlo, who had been christened
Karl, fell asleep with his head on Madame’s shoulder;
snoring peacefully, despite the screams, shrieks, howls,
and maledictions which were the invariable accompaniment
of the poker-game.</p>

<p class='c009'>The train bundled into Smutchester some hours later;
a string of cabs conveyed the Impresario, his wife, and
the principal members of his company to the Crown
Diamonds Hotel. Before he sought his couch that night
the revengeful Alberto Fumaroli had interviewed the
<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">chef</span></i> and bribed him with the gift of a box of regalias
from the cedar smoking-cabinet of a King, to aid in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>the carrying-out of the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">vendetta</span></i>. Josebattista Funkmuller
was not a regal judge of cigars; but these were
black, rank, and oily enough to have made an Emperor
most imperially sick. Besides, the De Melzi had, or
so he declared, once ascribed an indigestion which had
ruined, or so she swore, one of her grandest <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">scenas</span></i>, to an
omelette of his making, and the cook was not unwilling
that the haughty spirit of the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cantatrice</span></i> should be
crushed. His complex nature, his cosmopolitan origin,
showed in the plan Josebattista Funkmuller now evolved
and placed before the revengeful tenor, who clasped him
to his bosom in an ecstasy of delight, planting at
the same time a huge, resounding kiss upon both his
cheeks.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is perfection!” Fumaroli cried. “My friend, it
can scarcely fail! If it should, <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">per Bacco</span></i>! the Fiend
himself is upon that insolent creature’s side! But I
never heard yet of his helping a woman to resist temptation—<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">oh,
mai!</span></i> it is he who spreads the board and invites
Eve.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And the tenor retired exultant. His sleeping-chamber
was next door to that of the hated <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cantatrice</span></i>. He
dressed upon the succeeding morning to the accompaniment
of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">roulades</span></i> trilled by the owner of the lovely throat
to which Fumaroli would so willingly have given the
fatal squeeze. And as Fumaroli, completing his frugal
morning ablutions by wiping his beautiful eyes and classic
temples very gingerly with a damp towel, paused to
listen, a smile of peculiar malignancy was only partly
obscured by the folds of the towel. But when the tenor
and the soprano encountered at the twelve o’clock
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">déjeuner</span></i>, Fumaroli’s politeness was excessive, and his
large, dark, brilliant eyes responded to every glance of
the gleaming black orbs of De Melzi with a languorous,
melting significance which almost caused her heart to
palpitate beneath her Parisian corsets. Concealed passion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>lay, it might be, behind an affectation of enmity
and ill-will.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Mai santo cielo!</span></i>” exclaimed the stout aunt, to whom
the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cantatrice</span></i> subsequently revealed her suspicions,
“thou guessest always as I myself have thought. The
unhappy man is devoured by a grand passion for my
Teresa. He grinds his teeth, he calls upon the saints,
he grows more bilious every day, and thou more beautiful.
One day he will declare himself——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And I shall lose an entertaining enemy, to find a
stupid lover,” gurgled Teresa. She was looking divine,
her dark beauty glowing like a gem in the setting of
an Eastern silk of shot turquoise and purple, fifty
yards of which an enamored noble of the Ukraine had
thrown upon the stage of the Opera House, St. Petersburg,
wound round the stem of a costly bouquet. She
glanced in the mirror as she kissed the black nose of her
Japanese pug. “Every man becomes stupid after a
while,” she went on. “Even Josebattista is in love
with me. He sends me a little note written on <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">papier
jambon</span></i> to entreat an interview.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My soul!” cried the stout aunt, “thou wilt not deny
him?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The saucy singer shook her head as Funkmuller tapped
at the door. One need not give in detail the interview
that eventuated. It is enough that the intended treachery
of Fumaroli was laid bare. His intended victim
laughed madly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But it is a <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cerotto</span></i>—what the English call a nincompoop,”
she gasped, pressing a laced handkerchief to her
streaming eyes. “If the heavens were to fall, then one
could catch larks; but the proverb says nothing about
nightingales.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She tossed her brilliant head and took a turn or two
upon the hotel sitting-room carpet, considering.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will keep this appointment,” said she.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>“<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Dio!</span></i> And risk thy precious reputation?” shrieked
the aunt.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Chi sa? Chi sa?</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Evviva l’opportunita!</span>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>hummed the provoking beauty. And she dealt the cook
a sparkling glance of such intelligence that he felt
Signor Alberto would never triumph. Relieved in mind,
Josebattista Funkmuller took his leave.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will return the King’s cigars,” he said, as he
pressed his garlic-scented mustache to the pearly
knuckles of the lady.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bah!” said she, “they were won in a raffle at
Vienna.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The door closed upon the disgusted <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef</span></i>, and reopened
ten minutes later to admit a waiter carrying
upon a salver a pretty three-cornered pink note with
a gold monogram in the corner. The writer entreated
the inestimable privilege of three minutes’ conversation
with Madame de Melzi in a private apartment in the
basement of the hotel. He did not propose to visit the
<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">prima donna</span></i> in her own rooms, even under the wing of
her aunt, for it was of supreme importance that tongues
should not be set wagging. Delicacy and respect prevented
him from suggesting an interview in the apartments
occupied by himself. On the neutral ground of
an office in the basement the interview might take place
without comment or interruption. He was, in fact, waiting
there for an answer.</p>

<p class='c009'>The answer came in the person of the singer herself,
charmingly dressed and radiant with loveliness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fie! What an underground hole! The window
barred, the blank wall of an area beyond it!” Her
beautiful nostrils quivered. “<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Caro mio</span></i>, you have in
that covered dish upon the table there something that
smells good. What is under the cover?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>“Look and see!” said the cunning tenor, with a provoking
smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am not curious,” responded Teresa, putting both
hands behind her and leaning her back against the door.
“Come, hurry up! One of your three minutes has
gone by, the other two will follow, and I shall be
obliged to take myself off without having heard this
mysterious revelation. What is it?” She showed a
double row of pearl-hued teeth in a mischievous smile.
“Shall I guess? You have, by chance, fallen in love
with me, and wish to tell me so? How dull and unoriginal!
A vivacious, interesting enemy is to be preferred
a million times before a stupid friend or a commonplace
adorer.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Grazie a Dio!</span></i>” said the tenor, “I am not in love
with you.” But at that moment he was actually upon
the verge; and the dull, dampish little basement room,
floored with kamptulicon warmed by a grudging little
gas-stove, its walls adorned with a few obsolete and
hideous prints, its oilcloth-covered table, on which stood
the mysterious dish, closely covered, bubbling over a
spirit lamp and flanked by a spoon, fork, and plate—that
little room might have been the scene of a declaration
instead of a punishment had it not been for the
De Melzi’s amazing nonchalance. It would have been
pleasant to have seen the spiteful little arrow pierce
that lovely bosom. But instead of frowning or biting
her lips, Teresa laughed with the frankest grace in the
world.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dear Signor Alberto, Heaven has spared you much.
Besides, you are of those who esteem quantity above
quality—and, for a certain thing, I should be torn to
pieces by the ladies of the Chorus.” She shrugged her
shoulders. “Well, what is this mysterious communication?
The three minutes are up, the fumes of a gas
fire are bad for the throat—and I presume you of all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>people would not wish me to sing ‘Elsa’ with a veiled
voice, and disappoint the dear people of Smutchester,
and Messieurs the critics, who say such kind things.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Alberto Fumaroli’s brain spun round. Quick as
thought his supple hand went out; the wrist of the coquettish
<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">prima donna</span></i> was imprisoned as in a vise of
steel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ragazza!</span></i>” he gnashed out, “you shall pay for your
cursed insolence.” He swung the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cantatrice</span></i> from the
door, and Teresa, noting the convulsed workings of his
Corsican features, and devoured by the almost scorching
glare of his fierce eyes, felt a thrill of alarm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Oimè!</span></i> Signor,” she faltered, “what do you mean
by this violence? Recollect that we are not now upon
the stage.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A harsh laugh came from the bull throat of the tenor.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“By mystic Love</div>
      <div class='line'>Brought from the distance</div>
      <div class='line'>In thy hour of need.</div>
      <div class='line'>Behold me, O Elsa!</div>
      <div class='line'>Loveliest, purest—</div>
      <div class='line'>Thine own</div>
      <div class='line'>Unknown!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>he hummed. But his Elsa did not entreat to flow about
his feet like the river, or kiss them like the flowers blooming
amidst the grasses he trod. Struggling in vain for
release from the rude, unchivalrous grasp, an idea came
to her; she stooped her beautiful head and bit Lohengrin
smartly on the wrist, evoking, instead of further music,
a torrent of curses; and as Alberto danced and yelled in
agony, she darted from the room. With the key she had
previously extracted she locked the door; and as her
light footsteps and crisping draperies retreated along
the passage, the tenor realized that he was caught in
his own trap. Winding his handkerchief about his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>smarting wrist, he bestowed a few more hearty curses
upon Teresa, and sat down upon a horsehair-covered
chair to wait for deliverance. They could not possibly
give “Lohengrin” without him—there was no understudy
for the part. For her own sake, therefore, the
De Melzi would see him released in time to assume
the armor of the Knight of the Swan. <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ebbene!</span></i> There
was nothing to do but wait. He looked at his watch,
a superb timepiece encrusted with brilliants. Two
o’clock! And the opera did not commence until eight.
Six hours to spend in this underground hole, if no one
came to let him out. Patience! He would smoke. He
got over half an hour with the aid of the green cigarette-case.
Then he did a little pounding at the door.
This bruised his tender hands, and he soon left off and
took to shouting. To the utmost efforts of his magnificent
voice no response was made; the part of the hotel
basement in which his prison happened to be situated
was, in the daytime, when all the servants were engaged
in their various departments, almost deserted. Therefore,
after an hour of shouting, Fumaroli abandoned
his efforts.</p>

<p class='c009'>What was to be done? He could take a <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">siesta</span></i>, and
did, extended upon two of the grim horsehair chairs
with which the apartment was furnished. He slept
excellently for an hour, and woke hungry.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hungry! <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Diavolo!</span></i> with what a raging hunger—an
appetite of Gargantuan proportions, sharpened to the
pitch of famine by the bubbling gushes of savory steam
that jetted from underneath the cover of the mysterious
dish still simmering over its spirit-lamp upon the table!
He knew what that dish contained—his revenge, in fact.
Well, it had missed fire, the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">vendetta</span></i>. He who had
devised the ordeal of temptation for Teresa found himself
helpless, exposed to its fiendish seductions. Not that
he would be likely to yield, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">oh mai!</span></i> was it probable?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>He banished the idea with a gesture full of superb scorn
and a haughty smile. Never, a thousand times never!
The cunning Teresa should be disappointed. That evening’s
performance should be attacked by him as ever,
fasting, the voice of melody, the sonorous lungs, supported
by an empty frame. <em>Cospetto!</em> how savory the
smell that came from that covered dish! The unhappy
tenor moved to the table, snuffed it up in nosefuls,
thought of flinging the dish and its contents out of window—would
have done so had not the window been
barred.</p>

<p class='c009'>“After all, perhaps she means to keep me here all
night,” he thought, and rashly lifted the dish-cover, revealing
a vast and heaving plain of macaroni, over
which little rills of liquid butter wandered. Parmesan
cheese was not lacking to the dish, nor the bland juices
of the sliced tomato, and, like the violet by the wayside,
the modest garlic added its perfume to the distracting
bouquet. Fumaroli was only human, though, as a tenor,
divine. He had been shut up for four hours, fasting,
in company with a dish of macaroni.... Ah, Heaven!
he could endure no longer.... He drew up a chair,
grasped fork and spoon—fell to. In the act of finishing
the dish, he started, fancying that the silvery tinkle
of a feminine laugh sounded at the keyhole. But his
faculties were dulled by vast feeding; his anger, like
his appetite, had lost its edge. With an effort he disposed
of the last shreds of macaroni, the last trickle
of butter; and at seven o’clock a waiter, who accidentally
unlocked the door of the basement room, awakened a
plethoric sleeper from heavy dreams.</p>

<p class='c009'>“To the Opera House,” was the listless direction he
gave the driver of his hired brougham; as one in a dream
he entered by the stage-door, and strode to his room.</p>

<p class='c009'>The curtain had already risen upon grassy lowlands
in the neighborhood of Antwerp. Henry, King of Germany,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>seated under a spreading canvas oak, held court
with military pomp. Frederic of Telramond, wizard
husband of Ortrud, the witch, had stepped forward to
accuse Elsa of the murder of her brother, Gottlieb;
the King had cried, “Summon the maid!” and in answer
to the command, amidst the blare of brass and the
clashing of swords, the De Melzi, draped in pure white,
followed by her ladies, and looking the picture of virginal
innocence, moved dreamily into view:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“How like an angel!</div>
      <div class='line'>He who accuses her</div>
      <div class='line'>Must surely prove</div>
      <div class='line'>This maiden’s guilt.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Ah! had those who listened to the thrilling strains
that poured from those exquisite lips but guessed, as
Elsa described the appearance of her dream-defender,
her shining Knight, and sank upon her knees in an
ecstasy of passionate prayer, that the celestial deliverer
was at that moment gasping in the agonies of indigestion!</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Let me behold</div>
      <div class='line'>That form of light!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>entreated the maiden; and amidst the exclamations of
the eight-part chorus the swan-drawn bark approached
the bank; the noble, if somewhat fleshy, form of Alberto
Fumaroli, clad from head to foot in silvery mail, stepped
from it.... With lofty grace he waved his adieu to
the swan, he launched upon his opening strain of unaccompanied
melody.... Alas! how muffled, how farinaceous
those once clarion tones!... In labored accents,
amid the growing disappointment of the Smutchester
audience, Lohengrin announced his mission to
the King. As he folded the entranced Elsa to his oppressed
bosom, crying:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>“Elsa, I love thee!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“She-devil, you have ruined me!” he hissed in the
De Melzi’s ear.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“My hope, my solace,</div>
      <div class='line'>My hero, I am thine!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Teresa trilled in answer. And raising her love-illumined,
mischievously dancing eyes to her deliverer,
breathed in his ear: “Try pepsin!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c005'>“FREDDY &amp; C<sup>IE</sup>”</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It is always a perplexing question how to provide
for younger sons, and the immediate relatives of the
Honorable Freddy Foulkes had forfeited a considerable
amount of beauty sleep in connection with the problem.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My poor darling!” the Marchioness of Glanmire
sighed one day, more in sorrow than in anger, when
the Honorable Freddy brought his charming smile and
his graceful but unemployed person into her morning-room.
“If you could only find some congenial and at
the same time lucrative post that would take up your
time and absorb your spare energy, how grateful I
should be!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have found it,” said the Honorable Freddy, with
his cherubic smile. He possessed the blonde curling hair
and artless expression that may be symbolical of guilelessness
or the admirable mask of guile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank Heaven!” breathed his mother. Then, with
a sense that the thanksgiving might, after all, be premature,
she inquired: “But of what nature is this
post? Before it can be seriously considered, one must
be certain that it entails no loss of caste, demands nothing
derogatory in the nature of service from one who—I
need not remind you of your position, or of the fact
that your family must be considered.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She smoothed her darling’s silky hair, which exhaled
the choicest perfume of Bond Street, and kissed his brow,
as pure and shadowless as a slice of cream cheese, as
the young man replied:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dearest mother, you certainly need not.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>“Then tell me of this post. Is it anything,” the
Marchioness asked, “in the Diplomatic line?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Without a good deal of diplomacy a man would be
no good for the shop,” admitted Freddy; “but otherwise,
your guess is out.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Doubt darkened his mother’s eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t say,” she exclaimed, “that you have accepted
a Club Secretaryship? To me it seems the last resource
of the unsuccessful man.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It will never be mine,” said Freddy, “because I
can’t keep accounts, and they wouldn’t have me. Try
again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I trust it has nothing to do with Art,” breathed
the Marchioness, who loathed the children of canvas and
palette with an unreasonable loathing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In a way it has,” replied her son, “and in another
way it hasn’t. Come! I’ll give you a lead. There is
a good deal of straw in the business for one thing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You cannot contemplate casting in your lot with
the agricultural classes? No! I knew the example of
your unhappy cousin Reginald would prevent you from
adopting so wild a course ... but you spoke of straw.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of straw. And flowers. And tulles.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Flowers and tools! Gardening is a craze which has
become fashionable of late. But I cannot calmly see
you in an apron, potting plants.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is not a question of potting plants, but of potting
customers,” said Freddy, showing his white teeth in a
charming smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>A shudder convulsed Freddy’s mother. Freddy went
on, filially patting her handsome hand:</p>

<p class='c009'>“You see, I have decided, and gone into trade. If
I were a wealthy cad, I should keep a bucket-shop.
Being a poor gentleman, I am going to make a bonnet-shop
keep me. And, what is more—I intend to trim
all the bonnets myself!”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>There was no heart disease upon the maternal side
of the house. The Marchioness did not become pale blue,
and sink backwards, clutching at her corsage. She rose
to her feet and boxed her son’s right ear. He calmly
offered the left one for similar treatment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t send me out looking uneven,” he said simply.
“If I pride myself upon anything, it is a well-balanced
appearance. And I have to put in an hour or so at the
shop by-and-by.” He glanced in the mantel-mirror as
he spoke, and observing with gratification that his immaculate
necktie had escaped disarrangement, he twisted
his little mustache, smiled, and knew himself irresistible.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The shop! Degenerate boy!” cried his mother.
“Who is your partner in this—this enterprise?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You know her by sight, I think,” returned the
cherub coolly. “Mrs. Vivianson, widow of the man who
led the Doncaster Fusiliers to the top of Mealie Kop
and got shot there. Awfully fetching, and as clever as
they make them!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That woman one sees everywhere with a positive
<em>procession</em> of young men at her heels!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That woman, and no other.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She is hardly——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She is awfully <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chic</span></i>, especially in mourning.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will admit she has some style.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Admit</em>, when you and all the other women have
copied the color of her hair and the cut of her sleeves
for three seasons past! I like that!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Freddy was growing warm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When you accuse me of imitating the appearance of
a person of that kind,” said Lady Glanmire, in a cold
fury, “you insult your mother. And when you ally
yourself with her in the face of Society, as you are about
to do, you are going too far. As to this millinery establishment,
it shall not open.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>“My dear mother,” said Freddy, “it has been open
for a week.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He drew a card from an exquisite case mounted in
gold. On the pasteboard appeared the following inscription
in neat characters of copperplate:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>FREDDY &amp; C<sup><span class='fss'>IE</span></sup></div>
      <div class='line in4'><span class='sc'>Court Milliners</span>,</div>
      <div class='line in8'><span class='sc'>11, Condover Street, W.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“Freddy and Company!” murmured the stricken parent,
as she perused the announcement.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mrs. V. is company,” observed the son, with a spice
of vulgarity; “and uncommonly good company, too. As
for myself, my talents have at last found scope, and
millinery is my <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">métier</span></i>. How often haven’t you said
that no one has such exquisite taste in the arrangement
of flowers——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“As you, Freddy! It is true! But——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Haven’t you declared, over and over again, that you
have never had a maid who could put on a mantle,
adjust a fold of lace, or pin on a toque as skillfully as
your own son?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My boy, I own it. Still, millinery as a profession?
Can you call it <em>quite</em> manly for a man?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To spend one’s life in arranging combinations to
set off other women’s complexions. Can you call that
womanly for a woman? To my mind,” pursued Freddy,
“it is the only occupation for a man of real refinement.
To crown Beauty with beauty! To dream exquisite
confections, which shall add the one touch wanting to
exquisite youth or magnificent middle-age! To build
up with deft touches a creation which shall betray in
every detail, in every effect, the hand of a genius united
to the soul of a lover, and reap not only gold, but glory!
Would this not be Fame?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>“Ah! I no longer recognize you. You do not talk
like your dear old self!” cried the Marchioness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am glad of it,” replied Freddy, “for, frankly, I
was beginning to find my dear old self a bore.” He
drew out a watch, and his monogram and crest in diamonds
scintillated upon the case. His eye gleamed with
proud triumph as he said: “Ten to twelve. At twelve
I am due at Condover Street. Come, not as my mother,
if you are ashamed of my profession, but as a customer
ashamed of that bonnet” (Lady Glanmire was dressed
for walking), “which you ought to have given to your
cook long ago. Unless you would prefer your own
brougham, mine is at the door.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The vehicle in question bore the smartest appearance.
The Marchioness entered it without a murmur, and was
whirled to Condover Street. The name of Freddy &amp;
Cie. appeared in a delicate flourish of golden letters
above the chastely-decorated portals of the establishment,
and the plate-glass window contained nothing but an
assortment of plumes, ribbons, chiffons, and shapes of
the latest mode, but not a single completed article of
head apparel.</p>

<p class='c009'>The street was already blocked with carriages, the
vestibule packed, the shop thronged with a vast and
ever-increasing assemblage of women, amongst whom
Lady Glanmire recognized several of her dearest friends.
She wished she had not come, and looked for Freddy.
Freddy had vanished. His partner, Mrs. Vivianson, a
vividly-tinted, elegant brunette of some thirty summers,
assisted by three or four charming girls, modestly attired
and elegantly <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coiffée</span></i>, was busily engaged with those
would-be customers, not a few, who sought admission
to the inner room, whose pale green <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">portière</span></i> bore in gold
letters of embroidery the word <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">atelier</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You see,” she was saying, “to the outer shop admission
is <em>quite</em> free. We are charmed to see everybody
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>who likes to come, don’t you know? and show them the
latest shades and shapes and things. But consultation
with Monsieur Freddy—we charge five shillings for that.
Unusual? Perhaps. But Monsieur Freddy is Monsieur
Freddy!” And her shrug was worthy of a Parisienne.
“Why do you ask? ‘Is it true that he is the younger
son of the Duke of Deershire?’ Dear Madame, to <em>us</em>
he is Monsieur Freddy; and we seek no more.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A born tradeswoman!” thought Lady Glanmire, as
the silver coins were exchanged for little colored silk
tickets bearing mystic numbers. She moved forward
and tendered two half-crowns; and Freddy’s partner
and Freddy’s mother looked one another in the face.
But Mrs. Vivianson maintained an admirable composure.</p>

<p class='c009'>And then the curtains of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">atelier</span></i> parted, and a
young and pretty woman came out quickly. She was
charmingly dressed, and wore the most exquisite of hats,
and a murmur went up at sight of it. She stretched
out her hands to a friend who rushed impulsively to
meet her, and her voice broke in a sob of rapture.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you ever see anything so <em>sweet</em>? And he did it
like magic—one scarcely saw his fingers move!” she
cried; and her friend burst into exclamations of delight,
and a chorus rose up about them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Wonderful!</em>”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Extraordinary!</em>”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>He does it while you wait!</em>”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Just for curiosity, I really must!</em>”</p>

<p class='c009'>And a wave of eager women surged towards the green
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">portière</span></i>. Three went in, being previously deprived of
their headgear by the respectful attendants, who averred
that it put Monsieur Freddy’s taste out of gear for
the day to be compelled to gaze upon any creation
other than his own. And then it came to the turn of
Lady Glanmire.</p>

<p class='c009'>She, disbonneted, entered the sanctum. A pale, clear,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>golden light illumined it from above; the walls were
hung with draperies of delicate pink, the carpet was
moss-green. In the center of the apartment, upon a
broad, low divan, reclined the figure of a slender young
man. He wore a black satin mask, concealing the upper
part of his face, a loose, lounging suit of black velvet,
and slippers of the same with the embroidered initial
“F.” Round him stood, mute and attentive as slaves,
some half-dozen pretty young women, bearing trays of
trimmings of every conceivable kind. In the background
rose a grove of stands supporting hat-shapes, bonnet-shapes,
toque-foundations, the skeletons of every conceivable
kind of headgear.</p>

<p class='c009'>Silent, the Marchioness stood before her disguised
son.</p>

<p class='c009'>He gently put up his eyeglass, to accommodate
which aid to vision his mask had been specially
designed, and motioned her to the sitter’s chair, so constructed
that with a touch of Monsieur Freddy’s foot
upon a lever it would revolve, presenting the customer
from every point of view. He touched the lever now,
and chair and Marchioness spun slowly around. But
for the presence of the young ladies with their trays
of flowers, plumes, gauzes, and ribbons, Freddy’s mother
could have screamed. All the while Freddy remained
silent, absorbed in contemplation, as though trying to
fix upon his memory features seen for the first time. At
last he spoke.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tall,” he said, “and inclined to a becoming <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">embonpoint</span></i>.
The eyes blue-gray, the hair of auburn touched
with silver, the features, of the Anglo-Roman type, somewhat
severe in outline, the chin——A hat to suit this
client”—he spoke in a sad, sweet, mournful voice—“would
cost five guineas. A Marquise shape, of broadtail”—one
of the young lady attendants placed the
shape required in the artist’s hands—“the brim lined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>with a rich drapery of chenille and silk.... Needle
and thread, Miss Banks. Thank you....” His fingers
moved like white lightning as he deftly wielded the feminine
implement and snatched his materials from the
boxes proffered in succession by the girls. “Black and
white tips of ostrich falling over one side from a ring
of cut steel,” he continued in the same dreamy tone.
“A knot of point d’Irlande, with a heart of Neapolitan
violets, and”—he rose from the divan and lightly placed
the beautiful completed fabric upon the Marchioness’s
head—“here is your hat, Madame. Five guineas. Good-morning.
Next, please!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Emotion choked his mother’s utterance. At the same
moment she saw herself in the glass silently swung
towards her by one of the attendants, and knew that
she was suited to a marvel. She made her exit, paid her
five guineas, and returned home, embarrassed by the
discovery that there was an artist in the family.</p>

<p class='c009'>One thing was clear, no more was to be said. The
<em>Maison Freddy</em> became the morning resort of the smart
world; it was considered the thing to have hats made
while Society waited. True, they came to pieces easily,
not being copper-nailed and riveted, so to speak; but
what poems they were! The charming conversation of
Monsieur Freddy, the half-mystery that veiled his identity,
as his semi-mask partially concealed his fair and
smiling countenance, added to the attractions of the
Condover Street <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">atelier</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Money rolled in; the banking account of the partners
grew plethoric; and then Mrs. Vivianson, in spite of the
claims of the business upon her time, in spite of the
Platonic standpoint she had up to the present maintained
in her relations with Freddy, began to be jealous.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Or—no! I will not admit that such a thing is possible!”
she said, as she looked through some recent entries
in the day-book of the firm. “But that American
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>millionairess girl comes too often. She has bought a
hat every day for three weeks past. Good for business
in one way, but bad for it in another. If he should
marry, what becomes of the <em>Maison Freddy</em>?”</p>

<p class='c009'>She sighed and passed between the curtains. It was
the slack time after luncheon, and Freddy was enjoying
a moment’s interval. Stretched on his divan, his embroidered
slippers elevated in the air, he smoked a perfumed
cigarette surrounded by the materials of his craft.
He smiled at Mrs. Vivianson as she entered, and then
raised his aristocratic eyebrows in surprise.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Has anything gone wrong? You swept in as tragically
as my mother when she comes to disown me. She
does it regularly every week, and as regularly takes me
on again.” He exhaled a scented cloud, and smiled
once more.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Freddy,” said Mrs. Vivianson, going direct to the
point, “this little speculation of ours has turned out very
well, hasn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Beyond dreams!” acquiesced Freddy. She went on:</p>

<p class='c009'>“You came to me a penniless detrimental, with a talent
of which nobody guessed that anything could be
made. I gave this gift a chance to develop. I set you
on your legs, and——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Me voici!</span></i> You don’t want me to rise up and bless
you, do you?” said Freddy, with half-closed eyes.
“Thanks awfully, you know, all the same!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know that I want thanks, quite,” said Mrs.
Vivianson. “I’ve had back every penny that I invested,
and pulled off a bouncing profit. Your share amounts to
a handsome sum. In a little while you’ll be able to pay
your debts.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall never do that!” said Freddy, with feeling.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Marry, and leave me—perhaps,” went on Mrs.
Vivianson. A shade swept over her face, her dark eyes
glowed somberly, the lines of her mouth hardened.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>“Keep as you are!” cried Freddy, rebounding to a
sitting position on the divan.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where’s that new Medici shape in gold rice-straw
and the amber <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">crêpe chiffon</span></i>, and the orange roses with
crimson hearts?” His nimble fingers darted hither and
thither, his eyes shone, and his cheeks were flushed with
the enthusiasm of the artist. “A tuft of black and yellow
cock’s feathers, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la Mephistophele</span></i>,” he cried, “a
topaz buckle, and it is finished. You must wear with it
a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jabot</span></i> of yellow <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">point d’Alençon</span></i>. It is the hat of hats
for a jealous woman!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How dare you!” cried Mrs. Vivianson. But Freddy
did not seem to hear her—he was rapt in the contemplation
of the new masterpiece; and as he rose and gracefully
placed it on his partner’s head, Miss Cornelia Vanderdecken
was ushered in. She was superbly beautiful
in the ivory-skinned, jetty-locked, slender American
style, and she wore a hat that Freddy had made the day
before, which set off her charms to admiration.</p>

<p class='c009'>She occupied the sitter’s chair as Mrs. Vivianson
glided from the room, and Freddy’s blue eyes dwelt
upon her worshipingly. To do him justice, he had lost
his heart before he learned that Cornelia was an heiress.
Now words escaped him that brought a faint pink stain
to her ivory cheek.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah!” he cried impulsively, “you are ruining my
business.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, why, Monsieur Freddy? Please tell me!” asked
Miss Vanderdecken, with naïve curiosity.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because,” said Freddy, while a bright blush showed
beyond the limits of his black satin mask, “you are so
beautiful that it is torture to make hats for other women—since
I have seen you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a pause. Then Miss Cornelia’s silk foundations
rustled as she turned resolutely toward the
divan.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>“I can’t return the compliment,” she said, “by telling
you that it is torture to me to wear hats made by
any other man since I have seen you, for other men
don’t make hats, and I can’t really see you through
that thing you wear over your face. But——”</p>

<p class='c009'>Her voice faltered, and Freddy, with a gesture, dismissed
his lady assistants. Then he removed his mask.
Their eyes met, and Cornelia uttered a faint exclamation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh my! You’re just like him!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who is he?” asked Freddy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t quite say, because I don’t know,” returned
Cornelia; “but all girls have their ideals, from the time
they wear Swiss pinafores to the time they wear forty-eight
inch corsets; and I won’t deny”—her voice trembled—“but
what you fill the bill. My! What <em>are</em>
you doing?”</p>

<p class='c009'>For Freddy had grasped his materials and was making
a hat. It was of palest blush tulle, with a crown of
pink roses, and an aigrette of flamingo plumes was
fastened with a Cupid’s bow in pink topaz.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Love’s first confession,” the young man murmured
as he bit off the last thread, “should be whispered beneath
a hat like this.” And he gracefully placed it on
Cornelia’s raven hair.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Vivianson, her ear to the keyhole of a side door,
quivered from head to foot with rage and jealousy.
Time was when he, a penniless, high-bred boy, had implored
her to marry him. Now—her blood boiled at
the remembrance of the half hint, the veiled suggestion
she had made, that they should unite in a more intimate
partnership than that already consolidated. With her
jealousy was mingled despair. As long as Freddy and
his hats remained the fashion, the shop would pay, and
pay royally. There had as yet occurred no abatement
in the onflow of aristocratic patronage. To avow his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>identity—never really doubted—to become an engaged
man, meant ruin to the business. The blood hummed in
her head. She clung to the door-handle and entered, as
Freddy, with real grace and eloquence, pleaded his suit.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you are really a Marquis’s second son, though
you make hats for money?” she heard Cornelia say. “I
always guessed you had real old English blood in you,
from the tone of your voice and the shape of your finger-nails,
even when you wore a mask. And it seemed
as though I couldn’t do anything but buy hats. I surmised
it was vanity at the time, but now I guess it was—love!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dearest!” said Freddy, bending his blonde head
over her jeweled hands. “My Cornelia! I will make
you a hat every day when you are married. Ah! I have
it! You shall wear one of mine to go away in upon the
day we are wed, the inspiration of a bridegroom, thought
out and achieved between the church door and the chancel.
What an idea for a lover! What an advertisement
for the shop!” His blue eyes beamed at the thought.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Cornelia’s face fell.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know how to say it, dear, but we shall never
be married. Poppa is perfectly rocky on one point, and
that is that the man I hitch up with shall never have
dabbled as much as his little finger in trade. ‘You have
dollars enough to buy one of the real high-toned sort,’
he keeps saying, ‘and if blood royal is to be got for
money, Silas P. Vanderdecken is the man to get it.
So run along and play, little girl, till the right man
comes along.’ And I know he’ll say you’re the wrong
one!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Freddy’s complexion, grown transparent from excess
of emotion and lack of exercise, paled to an ivory hue.
His sedentary life had softened his condition and unstrung
his nerves. He adored Cornelia, and had looked
forward to a lifetime spent in adorning her beauty with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>bonnets of the most becoming shapes and designs. Now
that a coarse Transatlantic millionaire with soft shirt-fronts
and broad-leaved felt hats might step in and shatter
for ever his beautiful dream of union, bitter revulsion
seized him. He feared his fate. What was he?
The second son of a poor Marquis, with a particularly
healthy elder brother. He looked upon the chiffons, the
flowers and the feathers that surrounded him, and felt
that the hopes of a heart reared upon so frail a basis
were insecure indeed. Then his old blood rallied to his
heart, and he rose from the divan and clasped the now
tearful Cornelia to his breast.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go, my dearest,” he said, “tell all to your father—plead
for me. Do not write or wire—bring me his verdict
to-morrow. Meanwhile I will compose two hats.
Each shall be a masterpiece—a swan-song of my Art.
One is to be worn if”—his voice broke—“if I am to be
happy; the other if I am fated to despair. Go now, for
I must be alone to carry out my inspiration.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And Cornelia went. Then Freddy, sternly refusing
to receive any more customers that day, set himself to
the completion of his task. Before very long both hats
were actualities. Hat Number One was an Empire
shape of dead-leaf beaver, the crown draped with dove-colored
silk, a spray of sere oak-leaves and rue in front,
a fine scarf of black lace, partly to veil the face of the
wearer, thrown back over one side of the brim and
caught with a clasp of black pearls set in oxidized silver.
It breathed of chastened woe and temperate sadness,
and was to be worn if Papa Vanderdecken persisted
in refusing to accept Freddy as a suitor.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Hat Number Two! It was of the palest blue
guipure straw, draped with coral silk and Cluny lace.
In front was a spray of moss rosebuds and forget-me-nots,
dove’s wings of burnished hues were set at either
side. It was the very hat to be worn by a bringer of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>joyful news, the ideal hat under which might be appropriately
exchanged the first kiss of plighted passion.
Upon it Freddy pinned a fairy-like card, white and
gold-edged.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If I am to be happy, wear this,” was written upon
it; and upon a buff card attached to the hat of rejection
he inscribed: “Wear this, if I am to be unhappy.”
Then he closed the large double bandbox in which he had
packed the hats, breathed a kiss into the folds of the
silver paper, and, ringing the bell, bade a messenger
carry the box to the hotel at which Cornelia Vanderdecken
was staying, and where, millionairess though she
was, she was still content to dress with the help of a
deft maid and the adoration of a devoted companion.
Then the exhausted artist fell back on the divan. Cornelia
was to come at twelve upon the morrow.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then I shall learn my fate,” said Freddy. He drove
home in his brougham, and passed a sleepless night.
The fateful hour found him again upon his divan, surrounded
by the materials of his craft, waiting feverishly
for Cornelia.</p>

<p class='c009'>The curtains parted. He started up at the rustling
of her gown and the jingling of her bangles. Horror!
she wore the somber hat of sorrow, though under its
shadow her face was curiously bright.</p>

<p class='c009'>She advanced toward Freddy. He reeled and staggered
backward, raised his white hand to his delicate
throat, and fell fainting amongst his cushions. Cornelia
screamed. Mrs. Vivianson and her young ladies came
hurrying in. As the stylish widow noted Cornelia’s
headgear, her eyes flashed and joy was in her face.
Then it clouded over, for she knew that Papa Vanderdecken
had been coaxed over, and Freddy was an accepted
man. My reader, being exceptionally acute, will
realize that the jealous woman had changed the tickets
on the hats.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>“Not that it was much use,” she avowed to herself,
as she entered with smelling-salts and burnt feathers to
restore Freddy’s consciousness. “When he revives, she
will tell him the truth.” But Freddy only regained
consciousness to lose it in the ravings of delirium. He
had an attack of brain fever, in which he wandered
through groves of bonnet shops, looking unavailingly
for Cornelia. And then came the crisis, and he woke
up with an ice-bandage on, to find himself in his bedroom
at Glanmire House, with the Marchioness leaning
over him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mother, my heart is broken,” said the boy—he was
really little more. “The world exists no more for me.
Let me make my last hat—and leave it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Freddy, don’t you know me?” gasped Cornelia
in the background; but the repentant woman who had
brought about all this trouble drew the girl away.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Even good news broken suddenly to him in his weak
state,” said Mrs. Vivianson in a rapid whisper, “may
prove fatal. I have a plan which may gradually enlighten
him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I trust you,” said Cornelia. “You have saved his
life with your nursing. Now give him back to me!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hush!” said Mrs. Vivianson.</p>

<p class='c009'>She had rapidly dispatched a messenger to Condover
Street, and now, as Freddy again opened his eyes and
repeated his piteous request, the messenger returned.
Then all present gathered about the bed, whose inmate
had been raised upon supporting pillows. It was a queer
scene as the shaded electric light above the bed played
upon Freddy’s pallid features, showing the ravages of
sickness there. “Now!” said Mrs. Vivianson. She
placed the milliner’s box upon the bed, and Freddy’s
feeble fingers, diving into it, drew forth a spray of orange
blossoms and a diaphanous cloud of filmy lace.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Black—not white!” Freddy gasped brokenly. “It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>is a mourning toque that I must make. Let Cornelia
wear it at my funeral.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cornelia will not wear it at your funeral, Freddy,”
said Mrs. Vivianson, bending over him; “for she is
going to marry you, not to bury you.” And, drawing
the tearful girl to Freddy’s side, she flung over her
beautiful head the bridal veil, and crowned her with a
wreath of orange blossoms. And as, with a feeble cry,
Freddy opened his wasted arms and Cornelia fell into
them, Mrs. Vivianson, her work of atonement completed,
pressed the offered hand of Freddy’s mother, and hurried
out of the room and out of the story. Which ends,
as stories ought, happily for the lovers, who are now
honeymooning in the Riviera.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>UNDER THE ELECTRICS<br /> <span class='large'>A SHOW-LADY IS ELOQUENT</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Really, my dear, I think the man has gone a bit too
far. Writes a play with a fast young lady in the Profession
for the heroine—and where he got his model
from I can’t imagine—and then writes to the papers
to explain, accounting for her past being a bit off color—<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">twiggez-vous?</span></i>—by
saying she isn’t a Chorus-lady, only
a Show-lady.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gracious! I’m short of a bit of wig-paste, my pet
complexion-color No. 2. Any lady present got half a
stick to lend? I want to look my special best to-night:
<em>somebody in the stalls</em>, don’tcherknow! Chuck it over!—mind
that bottle of Bass! I’m aware beer is bad for
the liver, but such a nourishing tonic, isn’t it? When I
get back to the theater, tired after a sixty-mile ride in
somebody’s 20 h.p. Gohard—<em>twiggez?</em>—a tumbler with
a good head to it makes my dear old self again in a
twink.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Half-hour? That new call-boy must be spoke to on
the quiet, dears. Such manners, putting his nasty little
head right into the show-ladies’ dressing-room when he
calls. I suggest, girlies, that when we’re all running
down for the general entrance in the First Act—and
that staircase on the prompt side is the narrowest I
ever struck—I suggest that when we meet that little
brute—he’s always coming up to give the principals the
last call—I suggest that each girl bumps his head against
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>the wall as she goes by! That’ll make twenty bumps,
and do him lots of good, too!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Miss de la Regy, dear, I lent you my blue pencil last
night. Hand it over, there’s a good old sort, when
you’ve given the customary languish to your eyes, love.
What are you saying? Stage-Manager’s order that we’re
not to grease-black our eyelashes so much, as some people
say it looks fair hideous from the front? Tell him
to consume his own smoke next time he’s in a beast of
a cooker. Why don’t he tell <em>her</em> to mind her own business?—I’m
sure she’s old enough! What I say is, I’ve
always been accustomed to put lots on mine, and I don’t
see myself altering my usual make-up at this time o’
day. Do you? Not much?—I rather thought so. What
else does he say?—he’ll be obliged if we’ll wear the chin-strap
of our Hussar busbies down instead of tucked up
inside ’em? What I say is—and I’m sure you’ll agree
with me, girls—that it’s bad enough to have to wear a
fur hat with a red bag hangin’ over the top, without
marking a young lady’s face in an unbecoming way with
a chin-strap. Also he insists—what price him?—he <em>insists</em>
on our leavin’ our Bridgehands down in the dressing-room,
and not coming on the stage with ’em stuck
in the fronts of our tunics, in defiance of the Army Regulations?
Rot the Regulations, and bother the Stage-Manager!
How <em>she</em> must have been nagging at him,
mustn’t she?—because he <em>can</em> be quite too frightfully
nice and gentlemanly when he likes. I will speak up
for him that much. Not that I ever was a special favorite—I
keep myself to myself too much. Different
to some people not so far off. <em>Twiggez?</em> I’ve my pride,
that’s what I say, if I am a Show-girl!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thirty-five shillings a week, with <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">matinées</span></i>—you
can’t say it’s much to look like a lady on, can you now?
No, but what a girl with taste and clever fingers, and
a knack of getting what she wants at a remnant sale—and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>the things those forward creatures in black cashmere
<em>Princess</em> robes try to shove down a lady-customer’s
throat are generally the things she could buy elsewhere
new for less money—not but that a girl with her head
screwed on the right way can turn out in first-class style
for less than some people would think, and get credit in
<em>some quarters we know of</em>—this is a beastly, spiteful
world, my dear—for taking presents right and left.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, who has been and hung my wig on the electric
light? If the person considers that a practical joke, it
shows—that’s what I say!—it shows that she’s descended
from the lowest circles. I won’t pretend I don’t suspect
who has been up to her little games again, and,
though I should, <em>as a lady</em>, be sorry to behave otherwise,
I must caution her, unless she wishes to find her
military boots full of prepared chalk one o’ these nights,
to quit and chuck ’em.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Quarter of an hour! That <em>was</em> clever of you, Miss
Enderville dear, to shut that imp’s head in the door
before he could pop it back again. Well, there! if you
haven’t got another diamond ring!... Left at the
stage-door office, addressed to you, by a perfect stranger,
who hasn’t even enclosed a line.... Perhaps you’ll
meet him in a better land, dear; he seems a lot too shy
for this one. Not that I admire the three-speeds-forward
sort of fellow, but there is such a thing as being too
backward in coming up to the scratch—twig?</p>

<p class='c009'>“I ought to know something about that, considering
which my life was spoiled—never you mind how long
ago, because dates are a rotten nuisance—by one of
those hang-backers who want the young woman—the
young lady, I should say—to make all the pace for both
sides. It was during the three-hundred night run of——There!
I’ve forgotten the name of the gay old show,
but Miss de la Regy was in it with me—one of the Tall
Eleven, weren’t you, Miss de la Regy dear? And we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>were Anchovian Brigands in the First Act—Sardinian
Brigands, did you say? I knew it had something to do
with the beginning of a dinner at the Savoy—and Marie
Antoinette gentlemen in powdered wigs and long, gold-headed
canes in the Second, and in the Final Tableau
British tars in pink silk fleshings, pale blue socks, and
black pumps, and Union Jacks. I remember how I fancied
myself in that costume, and how frightfully it
fetched <em>him</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Me keeping my eyes very much to myself in those
days, new to the Profession as I was, I didn’t tumble to
the fact of having made a regular conquest till a girl
older than me twigged and gave me a hint—then I saw
him sitting in the stalls, dear, if you’ll believe me!—dash
it! I’ve dropped my powder-puff in the water-jug!—with
his mouth wide open—not a becoming thing, but
a sign of true feeling.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He was fair and pale and slim, with large blue eyes,
and lovely linen, and a diamond stud in the shirt-front,
and a gardenia in the buttonhole was good form then,
and the white waistcoats were twill. To-day his waistcoat
would be heliotrope watered silk, and his shirt-front
embroidered cambric, and if he showed more than
an inch of platinum watch-chain, he’d be outcast for
ever from his kind. Bless you! men think as much of
being in the fashion as we do, take my word for it,
dear.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He kept his mouth open, as I’ve said, all through
the evening, only putting the knob of his stick into it
sometimes—silver knobs were all the go then—and never
took his eyes off me. ‘You’ve made a victim, Daisy,’
says one of the girls as we did a step off to the chorus,
two by two, ‘and don’t you forget to make hay while
the sun shines!’ I thanked her to keep her advice to
herself, and moved proudly away, but my heart was
doing ragtime under my corsets, and no mistake about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>it. When we ran downstairs after the General Entrance
and the Final Tableau, I took off as much make-up
as I thought necessary, and dressed in a hurry, wishing
I’d come to business in a more stylish get-up. And
as I came out between the swing-leaves of the stage-door,
I saw <em>him</em> outside in an overcoat with a sable collar, a
crush hat, and a white muffler. Dark as the light was,
he knew me, and I recognized him, his mouth being ajar,
same as during the show, and his eyes being fixed in the
same intense gaze, which I don’t blush to own gave me
a sensation like what you have when the shampooing
young woman at the Turkish Baths stands you up in
the corner of a room lined with hot tiles and fires cold
water at you from the other end of it out of a rubber
hose.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Well, have you found his name out yet, Daisy, old
girl?’ was the question in the dressing-room next night.
I felt red-hot with good old-crusted shame, when I found
out that it was generally known he’d followed me down
Wellington Street to my ’bus—not a Vanguard, but a
gee-gee-er in those days—and stood on the splashy curb
to see me get in, without offering an utterance—which
I dare say if he had I should have shrieked for a policeman,
me being young and shy. No, I’d no idea what
his name was, nor nothing more than that he looked the
complete swell, and was evidently a regular goner—<em>twiggez?</em>—on
the personal charms of yours truly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you’ll believe me, there wasn’t a line or a rosebud
waiting for me at the stage-door next night, though he
sat in the same stall and stared in the same marked way
all through the evening. Perhaps he might for ever have
remained anonymous, but that the girl who dressed on
my left hand—quite a rattlingly good sort, but with a
passion for eating pickled gherkins out of the bottle with
a fork during all the stage waits and intervals such as
I’ve never seen equaled—that girl happened to know
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>the man—middle-aged toff, with his head through his
hair and a pane in his eye—who was in the stall next
my conquest the night before. She applied the pump—<em>twiggez?</em>—and
learned the name and title of one I shall
always remember, even though things never came to
nothing definite betwixt us—twig?</p>

<p class='c009'>“He was a Viscount—sable and not musquash—the
genuine article, not dyed or made up of inferior skins;
blow on the hairs and hold it to the light, you will not
see the fatally regular line that bears testimony to deception.
Lord Polkstone, eldest son of the Earl of ——.
Well, there, if I haven’t been and forgotten his dadda’s
title! Rolling in money, and an only boy. It was less
usual then than now for a peer to pick a life-partner
among the Show-girls, but just to keep us bright and
chirpy, the thing was occasionally done—twig? And
there Lord Polkstone sat night after night, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">matinée</span></i> after
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">matinée</span></i>, in the same place in the stalls, with his mouth
open and his large blue eyes nailed upon the features
of yours truly. Whenever I came out after the show,
there he was waiting, but it went no farther. Pitying
his bashfulness, I might—I don’t say I would, but I
<em>might</em>—have passed a ladylike remark upon the weather,
and broken the ice that way. But every girl in my
room—the Tall Eleven dressed in one together—every
girl’s unanimous advice was, ‘Let him speak first, Daisy.’
Then they’d simply split with laughing and have to wipe
their eyes. Me, being young and unsophis—I forget how
to spell the rest of that word, but it means jolly fresh
and green—never suspected them of pulling my leg. I
took their crocodileish advice, and waited for Lord Polkstone
to speak. My dear, I’ve wondered since how it was
I never suspected the truth! Weeks went by, and the
affair had got no farther. Young and inexperienced as
I was, I could see by his eye that his was no Sunday-to-Monday
affection, but a real, lasting devotion of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>washable kind. Knowing that, helped me to go on waiting,
though I was dying to hear his voice. But he never
spoke nor wrote, though several other people did, and,
my attention being otherwise taken up, I treated those
fellows with more than indifference.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I remember the Commissionaire—an obliging person
when not under the influence of whisky—telling me that
what he called a rum party had left several bouquets
at the stage-door—no name being on them, and without
saying who for—which seemed uncommonly queer.
Afterward it flashed on me—but there! never mind!</p>

<p class='c009'>“If I had ever said a word to that dear when his imploring
eyes met mine, and lingered on the curb when
I heard his faithful footsteps following me to my ’bus,
the mask would have fallen, dear, and the blooming mystery
been brought to light. But it shows the kind of
girl I was in those days, that with ‘Good-evening,’ ready
on the tip of my tongue, I shut my mouth and didn’t say
it. If I had, I might have been a Countess now, sitting
in a turret and sewing tapestry, or walking about
a large estate in a tailor-made gown, showing happy cottagers
how to do dairy-work.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s my romance, dear—is there a drop of Bass
left in that bottle? I’ve a thirst on me I wouldn’t sell
for four ‘d.’ Spite and malice on the part of some
I shall not condescend to accuse, helplessness on his part—poor,
devoted dear!—and ignorance on mine, nipped
it in the bud; and when he vanished from the stalls—didn’t
turn up at the stage-door—appearing in the Royal
Box, one night I shall never forget, with two young girls
in white and a dowager in a diamond fender, I knew
he’d given up the chase, and with it all thoughts of
poor little downy Me.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We were singing a deadly lively chorus about being
‘jolly, confoundedly jolly!’ and I stood and sang and
sniveled with the black running off my eyes. For even to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>my limited capacity, and without the sneering whispers
of a treacherous snake-in-the-grass, whose waist I had to
keep my arm round all the time, me playing boy to her
girl, first couple proscenium right, next the Royal Box,
where he sat with those three women—I could see how
I’d lost the prize. One glance at Lord Polkstone—prattling
away on his fingers to the best-looking of those two
girls, neither of ’em being over and above what I should
call passable—one glance revealed the truth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He was deaf and dumb!—and I had been waiting a
week of Sundays for him to speak out first. Hugging
my happy love and my innocent hope to my heart of
hearts—there’s an exercise in h’s for any person whose
weakness lies in the letter—I’d been waiting for what
couldn’t never come. Why hadn’t he have wrote? That
question I’ve often asked myself, and the answer is
that none of them who could have told Lord Polkstone
my name could understand the deaf and dumb alphabet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! it was a piercing shock—a freezing blow I’ve
never got over, dear, nor never shall. He married that
girl in white, that artful thing who could understand
his finger language and talk back.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Think what a blessing I lost in a husband who could
never contradict or shout at me. And I feel I could have
been an honor to the Peerage, and worn a coronet like
one born to it. I’ll stand another Bass, dear, if you’ll
tell the dresser to fetch it; or will you have a brandy-and-Polly?
You’ve hit it, dear, the girls were shocking
spiteful, but I was jolly well a lot too retiring and shy.
I’ve got over the weakness since, of course, and now I
positively make a point of speaking if one of ’em seems
quite unusually hangbacky.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Who knows,’ I say to myself, ‘perhaps he’s deaf
and dumb!’”</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>The lovely and high-born relict of a decrepit and enormously
wealthy commoner, she had sustained her husband’s
loss with a becoming display of sorrow, and
passed with exquisite grace and discretion through the
successive phases of the toilet indicative of connubial
woe. From a lovely chrysalis swathed in crape she had
changed to a dove-colored moth; the moth had become a
heliotrope butterfly, on the point of changing its wings
for a brighter pair, when the post brought her a letter
from one of her dearest friends. It bore the Zurich
postmark, and ran as follows:</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“I wonder, dear, whether you would mind being
troubled with Val for a day? He is coming up from
Seaton next Thursday on dentist’s leave, and one does
not care that a boy of sixteen—one can consider Val a
boy without stretching the imagination overmuch—should
be drifting anchorless in town. You will find
him grown and developed.... You see, I take it for
granted, in my own rude way, that you have already
said ‘Yes’ to my request.... The views here are divine—such
miles of eye-flight over the Lake of Constance
and the Rhine Valley! To quote poor Dynham,
who suffered much from the whey-cure, ‘every prospect
pleases, and only man is bile.’ Kiss Val for me.
My dear, the thought of his future is a continual anxiety.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>The title to keep up, and an income of barely eight
thousand pounds.... ‘Marry him,’ you will say; but
to whom? American heiresses are beginning to have an
exorbitant idea of their own value, and then Val’s is an
open, simple nature—<em>unworldly to a degree!</em> Not that
I, his mother, could wish him otherwise, but—you will
understand and sympathize, I know! And boys are so
easily molded by a woman who has charm! If you could
drop a word here and there, calculated to bring him to
a sense of the responsibility that rests upon his young
shoulders, the <em>duty</em> of restoring the diminished fortunes
of his house by a <em>really sensible</em> marriage.... I have
dinned and dinned, but I fear without much result.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

<p class='c009'>“Please address Val, ‘Care of Rev. H. Buntham, Seaton
College, near Grindsor.’—G.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Buntham is the house-master. V. says he ‘<em>understands
the fellows thoroughly</em>.’ Such a tribute, I think,
to a tutor <em>from</em> a boy.—G.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So a dainty monogrammed and coroneted note, on
heliotrope paper, with a thin but decided bordering of
black, was sent off to the Marquis of Valcourt, and Valcourt’s
hostess in prospective consulted a male relative
over the luncheon-table as to the most approved methods
of entertaining a schoolboy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Heaps of indigestible things to eat—sweet for choice—and
a box at the Gaiety if there’s a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">matinée</span></i>; if not,
the Hippodrome. But who’s the boy?” asked the male
relative.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lord Valcourt, Geraldine’s eldest.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The male relative pursed up his lips into the shape of
a whistle, and helped himself to a cutlet in expressive
silence.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>“Geraldine is devoted to him. He seems to have a
delightful nature, to be quite an ideal son!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That young—that young fellow!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You have met him, haven’t you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have had that privilege. I was one of the house-party
at Traye last September.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Geraldine asked me, but of course it was out of the
question....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course, poor Mussard’s death—quite too recent,”
murmured the male relative, taking green peas.</p>

<p class='c009'>Poor Mussard’s charming relict drooped her long-lashed,
brown eyes pensively, and the transparent lace,
that covered the hiding-place of the heart that had been
wrung with presumable anguish eighteen months before,
billowed under the impulse of a little dutiful sigh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What a prize for some lucky beggar with a big title
and empty pockets!” reflected the male relative, who
happened to be a brother, and could therefore contemplate
dispassionately. “Thirty—and looks three-and-twenty
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en plein jour</span></i>, without a pink-lined sunshade.”
Aloud he said: “So you are to entertain Valcourt—Tuesday,
I think you said?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thursday. It would be dear of you to come and
help me,” murmured Mrs. Mussard plaintively.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It would afford me delight to do so,” returned the
male relative unblushingly, “had I not unfortunately
an engagement to see a man about a fishing-tour in Norway.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tiresome! I know so little about modern schoolboys!”
murmured Mrs. Mussard.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The less you know about ’em, my dear Vivienne, the
better.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Having been a boy yourself,” the speaker’s sister
responded, with gentle acerbity, “you are naturally prejudiced.
But, going by Geraldine’s account, Valcourt
is not the ordinary kind of boy at all. Indeed, I have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>promised her to take him in hand, and impart a few
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viva voce</span></i> lessons in <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savoir faire</span></i> and worldly wisdom.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Have you?</em> By Jove, Vivie, you’ve taken something
upon yourself! ‘Angels rush in where demons fear to
tread....’ I’m mulling the quotation, but in its perfect
state it isn’t complimentary. May Valcourt profit
by your instructions on Thursday!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Thursday came, and with it Valcourt. He was pleasing
to view; a clean-limbed, broad-shouldered, straight-featured,
pink-and-white specimen of the well-bred English
youth of sixteen, with fair hair brushed into a silky
sweep above a wide, ingenuous brow; sleepy gray-green
eyes, with yellow and blue reflections in them, reminding
the beholder of tourmaline; well-kept hands, pleasing
manners, and a wide, innocent grin of the cherubic-angelic
kind, never more in evidence than when Valcourt
was engaged in some pursuit neither angelic nor
cherubic. Mrs. Mussard, at first sight, was conscious of
a brief maternal inclination to kiss him. Geraldine’s
boy was, she said to herself, “a perfect duck!” She
subdued the osculatory impulse, shook hands with the
boy cordially, and hoped the dentist had not hurt him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, thanks awfully,” said Valcourt, with his cherubic
grin. The teeth revealed were exceedingly white and
regular.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you had gas, of course?” proceeded his hostess.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When I have teeth out I generally do,” said Valcourt
carefully. “They always give you half a guinea
extra allowance for gas, so most of the fellows ask to
have it.” He touched his waistcoat pocket meditatively
as he spoke, and smiled, or rather grinned, again so
seraphically that Mrs. Mussard longed to tip him a ten-pound
note. She gave her young guest a sumptuous
luncheon, and, not without serious misgivings, commanded
the butler to produce the exhilarating beverage
of champagne.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>“A little sweet, isn’t it?” said Valcourt critically.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I thought that you—that is——” Mrs. Mussard
crumpled her delicate eyebrows in embarrassment, and
the butler permitted himself the shadow of a smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ladies like sweet wine,” remarked Valcourt. He
refused liqueur with coffee, but considered Mrs. Mussard’s
cigarettes “rather mild.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—I don’t usually smoke that brand,” his hostess
explained. “I—I ordered them on purpose for——”
She broke off, in sheer admiration of Valcourt’s beautiful
grin.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">matinée</span></i> for which she had secured a stage-box
did not commence until three. “Time for a little chat
in the drawing-room,” she thought, and ran over in her
mind a list of the things dear Geraldine would have
wished her to say. She bade the boy sit in the opposite
angle of her pet sofa, upholstered in shimmering lily-leaf
green, billowed with huge puffy pillows of apricot-yellow,
covered with cambric and Valenciennes. She
thought the harmony well completed by Valcourt’s sleek
fair head and inscrutable tourmaline eyes, and wished
for the first time that poor dear Mussard had left an
heir. Vague as the yearning was, it imparted a misty
softness to her brown eyes, and caused the corners of
her delicate lips to quiver. She drew a little nearer to
Valcourt, and laid her white jeweled hand softly upon
the muscular young arm, firm and hard beneath an uncommonly
well-cut sleeve.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear Valcourt,” she began.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your eyes are brown, aren’t they?” asked Valcourt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I believe they are,” murmured Mrs. Mussard. “My
dear boy, I trust that——”</p>

<p class='c009'>Valcourt shut his own sleepy tourmaline eyes and
sniffed, a long rapturous sniff. “Mother uses attar of
violets. It’s her pet scent. Jolly, but not so nice as
yours. What is it?” He sniffed again. “I can’t guess.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>’Mph! I give it up. I know!” The sleepy tourmaline
eyes opened, large and round and bright, the cherubic-angelic
smile suffused his features. “Why, it comes
from your hair!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“People have said that before. Oh! never mind my
hair!” Mrs. Mussard was not displeased, nevertheless.
“Tell me how you progress at School. You know your
mother is my dearest friend. I should so much like you
to remember that and confide in me, <em>almost</em> as you confide
in her!”</p>

<p class='c009'>A solemn, innocent expression came over Valcourt’s
face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right,” he said, after a pause, during which
he seemed to be listening to choirs of angels chanting
to the accompaniment of celestial harps. “I’ll tell you
things just exactly as I tell ’em to mother!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You dear!” exclaimed the impulsive young widow,
and kissed him. The smooth elastic skin, brownish-pink
as a new-laid egg, and dotted with sunny little
freckles, grew pinker under the velvet violence of the
lady’s lips. Valcourt turned the other cheek, with his
cherub’s smile, and less warmly, because more consciously,
his mother’s dearest friend saluted that also.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now,” he said, in his boyish voice, “what did you
want me to tell you about School? I’m not a sap at
books, and I don’t spend all my time in getting up my
muscles. I’m just an ordinary kind of fellow.... I
say, how pretty your nails are!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He took up one of Mrs. Mussard’s exquisitely manicured
hands, and, holding it to the tempered sunlight
that stole through the lace blinds, noted with appreciative,
if infantile, interest the pearly hues and rosy inward
radiances, the nicks and dimples of the wrist and
the delicate articulations of the fingers. Then, with a
droll, half-mischievous twinkle of the tourmaline eye
that was next the fair widow, he bent his sleek, fair head
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>and rubbed his cheek against the pretty hand caressingly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Silly boy!” breathed Mrs. Mussard.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I believe I am an awful ass sometimes,” agreed Valcourt
composedly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who says so?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My tutor and heaps of other fellows, and the Head—not
that he says so, but he looks as if he thought it!”
said Valcourt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Does the Head see a great deal of you?” asked Mrs.
Mussard, drawing away her hand and grasping at a
chance of improving the languishing conversation. Then
as Valcourt, with a grave air of reserve, nodded in reply,
“I am <em>so glad</em>!” breathed Mrs. Mussard gushingly; “because,
at your age, impressions received must sink in
deeply. And to be brought in contact with a personality
so marked must be impressive, mustn’t it?” she concluded,
rather lamely.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose so,” agreed Valcourt, examining the pattern
of the carpet. He looked a little sulky and a little
bored, and for sheer womanly desire of seeing the illuminations
rekindled Mrs. Mussard gave him her hand
again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are going into the Guards, aren’t you, by-and-by?”
she queried.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If I can get through,” said Valcourt, playing with
her rings and smiling. “I’m in the Army Class, mathematics
and swot generally. But I think our family’s
too old or something to produce brainy fellows. Cads
are cleverer, really, than we are.”</p>

<p class='c009'>His tone took a reflection of the purple, his finely-cut
profile looked for an instant hard as diamond and exquisite
as a cameo.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Mussard, sympathizing, said to herself: “After
all, why <em>should</em> he be clever?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Still, when one hasn’t much money,” she began,
reminiscent of the Duchess’s entreaty.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>“We’re beastly poor, of course,” admitted Valcourt.
“But as to clothes and horses and shootin’, tradespeople
will tick a fellow till the cows come home, and the millionaire
manufacturers who buy or rent fellows’ forests
and moors and rivers and things are always glad to get
the fellow himself to show with ’em; and the keepers
and gillies and chaps take care that he gets the best
that’s going generally. And so he does himself pretty
well all round.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That sort of thing is too—undignified!” said Mrs.
Mussard, “and too uncertain. A man of rank and title
must have a solid backing, a definite <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entourage</span></i>. You
must marry, and marry well.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mother always talks like that!” said Valcourt. “I
think,” he added, “she has somebody in her eye for
me!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who is she?” asked Mrs. Mussard sharply.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m not quite sure,” said Valcourt, his tourmaline
eyes narrowing as he smiled his angelic smile. “Dutch
Jewess, perhaps,” he added simply, “with barrels of
bullion and a family all nose.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Horrible!” cried Mrs. Mussard, shuddering.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Her brother’s in the Fifth,” let out Valcourt. “We
call him ‘Hooky Holland.’ Their father was secretary
to the Klaproths and made heaps of cash—‘cath’ Hooky
calls it. He never talks about anything but ‘cath,’ and
fellows punch him for it.” Valcourt doubled his right
hand scientifically, thumb well down, and glanced at it
with modest appreciation ere he resumed: “He has lots
of it, too, Hooky, and lends at interest—pretty thick
interest—to fellows who get broke at Bridge or baccarat!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh-h! You don’t play baccarat at school, surely!
Such an awfully gambling game!” expostulated Valcourt’s
hostess.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We go to school to be educated, you see,” said Valcourt,
in a slightly argumentative tone, “for what Buntham
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>calls ‘the business of life,’ and cards are part of a
fellow’s life, aren’t they? So they ought, instead of
being forbidden, to form part of what Old Cads calls the
curriculum. We call Buntham ‘Cads’ because he calls
us cads when we do anything that upsets him. He’s
a nervous beggar, and gets a good deal of upsetting.
My dame says he weighs himself at the end of every
term, and makes a note of the pounds he’s lost since the
beginning. When I go to Sandhurst she thinks he’ll
pick up a bit,” explained Valcourt with his angelic grin.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope your dame is a nice, motherly old person!”
breathed Mrs. Mussard.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’s nice—quite,” said Valcourt, “and awfully
obliging. I don’t know about being old—unless you’d
call thirty-three old.” Mrs. Mussard started slightly.
“When I have a cold she makes me jellies and things.
Awfully good things! And I give her concert tickets,
and sometimes we go on the river and have strawberries
and cream. Lots of our fellows tell her their love
affairs.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And some of ’em are in love with her,” went on Valcourt.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Mussard breathed quickly. Never before had she
realized what perils environ the young of the opposite
sex, even with the chaste environment of school bounds.
In her agitation she laid her hand on Valcourt’s shoulder.
“I hope—you do not fancy yourself in love with
her,” she uttered anxiously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not much catch!” said Valcourt, with the composure
of forty. “I got over that in my second year.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Silly boy!” Mrs. Mussard very gently smoothed
down a lock at the back of his head, which erected itself
in silky defiance above its fellows. “When love comes
to you, Valcourt,” she went on, with a vivid recollection
of the utterances of the inspired authoress of <cite>The Bride’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>Babble Book</cite>, “you will find out what it <em>really</em> means.
It is a great mystery, my dear boy, a sacred and solemn
unveiling of the heart——”</p>

<p class='c009'>She stopped, for Valcourt had turned his face up toward
hers, gently smiling, and revealing two neat rows
of milky white teeth. His tourmaline eyes had an odd
expression.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you speak, dear?” his fair Gamaliel asked. For
the impression upon her was that he had uttered two
words, and that they were, “Hooky’s sister!”</p>

<p class='c009'>But Valcourt shook his head. “I was only thinking.
A fellow like me ... has got to take what comes ...
the best he can get ... and the better it is, so much
the better for him, don’t you see? If he don’t like what
he gets, he doesn’t go about grousing. He generally
pretends he’s suited; and <em>she</em> pretends; and they get
into a groove—or they get into the newspapers,” said
Geraldine’s unworldly babe. “Beastly bad form to get
into the newspapers. I never mean to.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Mussard listened breathlessly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall have a rattling time,” said Valcourt, in his
soft, cooing voice, “till Hooky’s sister grows up, and
mother presents her, and then I shall marry her, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dearest boy, I hope not!” exclaimed Mrs. Mussard.
“Someone more suitable <em>must</em> be found,” she continued,
rapidly putting all the moneyed girls of her acquaintance
through a mental review. “Why should you not
marry beauty and birth as well as a banking account?
The three things are sometimes associated.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“German princes pick up girls of that kind,” said
Valcourt, his elbows upon his knees, and his round young
chin cupped in his hands, “and Austrian archdukes.
But why need it be a girl?” he went on, pressing up
the smooth young skin at his temples with his finger-tips,
so as to produce the effect of premature crows’-feet.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>“I don’t like girls—all red wrists and flat waists. Why
shouldn’t it be a woman, say a dozen years older—an
awfully pretty woman, rich, and in the best set, who’d
show me the ropes? I’m a jolly ass in some things. I
shall come no end of croppers when I go into society,
unless there’s somebody to give me the needful tip.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Mussard sat very upright. She looked at Valcourt;
the hand with which she had smoothed his hair
remained suspended in mid-air until she recollected it
and laid it over its companion in her lap.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Most young fellows beginning life go to other men’s
wives for advice,” said Valcourt. “Why shouldn’t I go
to my own?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Mussard’s chiseled scarlet lips moved as though
she had echoed, “Why not?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They—the chaps I’m talking of—are wild about ’em—the
other men’s wives. Yet nearly all of the women
are old enough to be their mothers.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Their grandmothers, sometimes,” said Mrs. Mussard
unkindly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then why shouldn’t I marry a woman who’s only
old enough to be my aunt—a young aunt! I’d make a
Marchioness of her, don’t you know! and she’d make—she
could make anything she liked of me!” said Valcourt,
turning his cherub smile and tourmaline eyes suddenly
on Mrs. Mussard. “<em>You</em> could!” The lovely
widow started violently, and flushed from the string of
pearls encircling her pretty throat to the little gold hair-waves
that crisped at her blue-veined temples. “You
<em>know</em> you could!” murmured Valcourt. The strong
young arm in the well-cut sleeve intercepted the retreating
movement that would have placed the lovely
widow in the uttermost corner of the sofa. The remonstrance
upon Vivienne’s lips was stifled by a kiss, given
with eloquence and decision, though the lips that administered
it were soft, and unshaded by even the rudiments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>of a mustache. “I’m seventeen the end of this term, and
five feet nine in my socks,” said Valcourt, a little breathlessly,
for the kiss had not been one-sided; “and—and
you’re simply awfully pretty. Marry me—I shall be of
age before you know it—and——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You dreadfully presuming boy!” There were tears
in the lovely eyes of the late Mr. Mussard’s lovely widow;
an unwonted throbbing in the region of her bodice imparted
a tremor to her voice that added to its charm.
“I shall write to your mother!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do!” said Valcourt, with his angelic smile. “She’ll
be awfully pleased! I wonder the idea didn’t occur to
her instead of to me, for she’s awfully clever, and I’m
rather an ass.... Five o’clock!” he exclaimed, as the
delicate chime of a Pompadour clock upon the mantelshelf
announced the hour.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you have missed the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">matinée</span></i>!” said Mrs. Mussard.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I preferred this!” said Valcourt, getting up. She
had no idea of his being taller than herself until she
found the tourmaline eyes looking down into hers.
“Good-bye, and thank you, Mrs. Mussard,” said the boyish,
ringing voice. “I’ve had an awfully pleasant day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Their hands met and lingered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t call me Mrs. Mussard any more; my—my
name is Vivienne,” she said in a half-whisper.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Jolly! Hooky’s sister’s is Bethsaba,” said Valcourt.
He made a quaint grimace, as though the word tasted
nasty, and Vivienne gave a little, musical, contented
laugh. “And I may come again, mayn’t I?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“This week,” nodded Mrs. Mussard.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll say it’s my tooth,” explained Geraldine’s guileless
offspring.</p>

<p class='c009'>He reached the door, the handle turned, when Mrs.
Mussard beckoned, and Valcourt came back.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should like to ask you,” she began hesitatingly—“not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>that it matters to me; but <em>still</em>, in your <em>own interests</em>——
And you know your mother is my dearest
friend!” ... Valcourt stood with the beautiful grin
upon his face, and Mrs. Mussard found the thing more
difficult to say than she had imagined. “Where did you—who
taught you to make love like—like that?—at your—at
your age.... I—it is——” Valcourt made no
reply in words, but the expression upon his face became
more celestial than before. “I hope kissing is not a feature
of the curriculum. But, understand clearly,” said
Mrs. Mussard, with that unusual tremor in her charming
voice, “that you are not for the future to kiss anybody
but me!” And as the door closed on Valcourt’s
heavenly grin and tourmaline eyes, she sat down to write
a letter to Geraldine.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>THE EVOLUTION OF THE FAIREST</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>If not absolutely a nincompoop, Gerald Delaurier Gandelish,
Esq., of Swellingham Mansions, Piccadilly, Undertherose
Cottage, Sunningwater, Berks, and Horshundam
Abbey, Miltshire, was undoubtedly a type of the
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">genus homo</span></i> recently classified by a distinguished K.C.
as soft-minded gentlemen. Strictly educated by a private
clerical tutor under the eye of pious parents of limited
worldly experience and unlimited prejudices, it was
not to be expected that Gerry, upon their dying and leaving
him in undisputed command of a handsome slice
of the golden cheese of worldly wealth, should not immediately
proceed to make ducks and drakes of it. He
essayed to win a name upon the Turf; and when I remind
you that, at a huge price, the youth became possessor
of that remarkable Derby race-horse, Duffer, by
Staggers out of Hansom Cab, from whom eighteen opponents
cantered away in the Prince’s year of ’90, leaving
the animal to finish the race at three lengths from
the starting-post, I have said all. Gerry dabbled “considerable,”
as our American relatives would say, in
stocks, and started a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">café chantant</span></i> on the open-air Parisian
plan, which was frequented only by stray cats
and London blacks, and has since been roofed in and
turned into tea-rooms. Sundry other investments of
Gerry’s resulted in the enrichment of several very shady
persons, and a consequent, and very considerable, diminution
in the large stock of ready money with which
Gerry had started his career. But though the edges of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>the slice of golden cheese had been a good deal nibbled,
the bulk of it remained, and Gerry’s Miltshire acres,
strictly entailed and worth eighty thousand pounds, with
another twenty thousand in Consols, and about half as
much again snugly invested in Home Rails, made him a
catch worth angling for in the eyes of many mothers.</p>

<p class='c009'>We have termed Gerry “soft-minded.” He was also
soft-hearted, soft-eyed, soft-voiced, soft-haired, soft-skinned,
and soft-mannered—the kind of youth women
who own to years of discretion like to pet and bully, the
kind of man schoolgirls call a “duck.” True, his neckties
aroused indignation in the breasts of intolerant
elderly gentlemen, the patterns of his tweeds afforded exquisite
amusement to members of the Household Brigade,
and his jewelry could not be gazed at without
winking by the unseasoned eye; but, despite these drawbacks,
Gerry was a gentleman. Without the stamp of
a public school or a select club, without the tone of the
best society—for, with the exception of a turfy baronet
or so and a couple of sporting peers, Gerry knew nobody
who was anybody—Gerry was decidedly a gentleman,
whose progress to the dogs was arrested, luckily for the
young prodigal, when he fell in love with the famous
burlesque actress, Miss Lottie Speranza, of the Levity
Theater.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of theaters and theatrical people Gerry may be said
to have known little or nothing until the enchanting
Lottie blazed upon his field of vision. Gerry’s worthy
parents, strict moralists both, had considered the theater
as the temple of Satan, and had exacted from their only
child a solemn promise that he would never enter one.
This promise Gerry had actually kept, contenting himself
with the entertainments offered by the music halls,
which his father had omitted to stigmatize and his
mother knew not of. But at the close of a festive dinner,
given by Gerry to a select party of “pals,” in a private
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>room at the Levity Restaurant, when a brief, lethargic
slumber obscured the senses of the youthful host, the
brilliant idea of conveying him to a box in the theater
upstairs occurred to one of his guests, and was forthwith
carried out. Emerging from a condition of coma, Gerry
found himself staring into a web of crossing and intersecting
limelights of varying hues, in which a dazzling
human butterfly, entangled, was beating quivering wings.
The butterfly had lustrous eyes, encircled with blue rims,
a complexion of theatrical red and white, and masses of
golden hair. Her twinkling feet beat out a measure to
which Gerry’s pulses began to dance madly. He sent
the goddess an invitation to supper, which was promptly
declined. He forwarded a stack of roses, which were
not acknowledged, and a muff-chain, turquoise and peridot,
which were returned to the address upon his card.
He felt hurt but happy at these rebuffs, which proved to
him that Miss Speranza was above reproach; and when
a bosom friend of his own age hinted that the prudish
fair one was playing the big game, and advised him to
try her with a motor-car, Gerry promptly converted the
bosom friend into a stranger by the simple process of
asking him to redeem a few of his I O U’s. This got
about, and caused Gerry’s other friends to turn sharp
round corners, or jump into hansoms when they saw
Gerry coming. Gerry hardly missed them, though the
man who could have afforded an introduction to his
charmer would have been welcomed with open arms.
He occupied the same box at the Levity nightly now,
and made up, in its murkiest corner, a good deal of the
nightly rest of which his clamant passion deprived him.
But he awakened, as by instinct, whenever Miss Speranza
tripped upon the stage; and the large-eyed, vacuous,
gorgeously-attired beauties who “went on” with the
Chorus—the Lotties, Maries, Daisies, Topsies of the noble
houses of Montague, Talbot, De Crespigny, and Delamere,—would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>languidly nudge each other at the passionately
prolonged plaudits of a particular pair of immaculate
white gloves, and wonder semi-audibly what
the man saw in Speranza, dear, to make such a bloomin’
silly fuss about?</p>

<p class='c009'>Gerry had occupied his watch-tower at the Levity
for six weeks or so, and was beginning to deteriorate
in appetite and complexion (so powerful are the effects
of passion unreturned), when Undertherose Cottage at
Sunningwater, a charming Thames-side residence of
the bijou kind, with small grounds and a capacious cellar,
a boat-house, and a house-boat, a pigeon-cote and
a private post-box, became suddenly vacant. The tenant,
a lady of many charms and much experience, who had
passed over to Gerry with the property, returned to her
native Paris to open a bonnet-shop; and Gerry, as he
wandered over the dwelling with the sanitary engineer
and decorator, who had <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">carte blanche</span></i> to do-up the place,
found himself strolling on the tiny lawn (in imagination)
by the visioned side of the enchantress who had
enthralled him, supping (also in imagination) with the
same divine creature in the duodecimo oak dining-room,
and smoking a cigarette in her delightful company upon
the balcony of the boudoir. Waking from these dreams
was a piquant anguish. Gerry indeed possessed the
cage, one of the most ideal nests for a honeymooning
pair imaginable; but in vain for the airy feminine songster
might the infatuated fowler spread nets and set
springs.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If we didn’t live in this confoundedly proper twentieth
century,” thought disconsolate Gerry, “a chappie
might hire a coach and eight, bribe a few bruisers to
repress attempts at rescue, snap her up respectfully as
she came out at the stage door, and absquatulate—no!
abduct’s the word. Not that I’d behave like a brute;
I’d marry her to-morrow if she’d only give me a chance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>to ask her. Marquises do that sort of thing, and their
families come round a bit and bless the young people.
She must have shown the door to dozens of ’em.” He
sighed, for where the possessor of a ripe old peerage
had failed, how could Gerald Gandelish, Esq., hope to
triumph? “And she’s so awfully proper and standoffish,
too,” he reflected. He wondered how many years
it had taken those privileged persons whom the lady
permitted to rank as her friends to attain that enviable
distinction. “I’ve never met a man who could, or
would, introduce me,” he added, pulling his mustache,
which from happily turning up at the corners had recently
acquired a decided tendency to droop. “Seemed
to shy at it, somehow; and so I shall take the initi—what-you-call—myself.
She shall know from the start
that my intentions are honorable, and, hang it! the
name’s a good one.... There’s been a Gandelish of
Horshundam ever since Henry the Eighth hanged the
abbot and turned out the monks, and put my ancestor
Gorbred in to keep the place warm. Gorbred was His
Majesty’s principal purveyor of sack and sugar, ‘and
divers dainty cates beside,’ as the Chronicle has it, and
must have given the Tudor unlimited tick, I gather.
Anyhow, if four centuries of landlording don’t make a
tradesman a gentleman, they ought to; and I can’t see——”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gerry climbed into his “Runhard” thirty horse-power
roadster, pulled down the talc mask of his driving cap
to preserve his eyes and complexion, and ran back to
town. That night, as he quitted his box at the conclusion
of the Levity performance (you will remember the
phenomenal run of <cite>The Idiot Girl</cite> in 19—!), he turned
up his coat collar with the air of a man resolved to
do or die, and boldly plunged into the little entry leading
to the stage door. The bemedaled military guardian
of those rigid portals, who had absorbed several of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>Gerry’s sovereigns without winking, regarded him with
a glazed eye and a stiff upper lip.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Would you kindly——” began Gerry.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the stage-doorkeeper paid no heed, busily engaged
as he was in delivering letters from a rack on the wall,
lettered S, into the hands of a slight little woman in a
rather shabby tweed ulster and plain felt hat. Gerry’s
heart jumped as he recognized his own handwriting upon
one of the envelopes.... Surely the tiny tin gods had
favored him! The little woman in the ulster and the
plain felt hat must be lady’s maid to the brilliant Speranza.
As she thrust the letters into her pockets, nodded
familiarly to the commissionaire, and came out of the
stage-door office, Gerry, his heart in his mouth and his
hat in his hand, stood in her way.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Miss—Madam——” he began. “If I might ask you——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s that?” shouted the commissionaire. As the
little woman stepped quickly backwards, Cerberus
emerged, purple and growling, from his den and reared
his huge body as a barrier before her. “Annoying the
lady, are ye?” he roared, with a fine forgetfulness of
Gerry’s sovereigns. “Wait till I knock your mouth
round to the back of your head, you kid-gloved young
blaggyard, you! Wait till——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Be quiet, O’Murphy!” said the little woman in a
tone and with an accent which raised her to the level of
lady’s companion in Gerry’s estimation. And as the
crestfallen O’Murphy retreated into his den, she said,
turning a plain little clever face, irradiated by a pair of
brilliant eyes, upon the crimson Gerry, “Did you wish
to speak to me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I certainly do, if you are any relative—or a member
of the household—of Miss Speranza,” Gerry stuttered.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a flash of eyes and teeth in the plain, insignificant
face.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>“Oh, yes,” said the little woman, “I live with Miss
Speranza.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gerry’s tongue grew large, impeding utterance, and
his palate dried up. Of all creatures upon earth this
little tweed-ulstered woman, in the well-worn felt hat
with the fatigued feather, seemed to him the most to
be envied.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You—you’re lucky,” he said lamely, and blushed
up to the roots of his hair, and down to the tips of his
toes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve known her ever since she knew herself,” said
the little companion. “We were girls together.” Gerry
could have laughed in her middle-aged face, but he only
handed her his card. “Oh yes,” she said after she had
glanced at it. “I seem to know the name. You have
written to her, haven’t you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sev-several times,” acquiesced Gerry hoarsely. “I
have ta-taken the privilege.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A great many other young gentlemen have taken it
too,” observed Miss Speranza’s companion.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then, as the swing doors behind her opened to let out
a blast of hot air and several grimy stage carpenters,
and the swing doors before her parted to let in a blast
of cold air as the men shouldered out, “Excuse me,”
she said, and shivered, and moved as though to pass. “It
is very cold here, and the brougham is waiting.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Beggin’ pardon!” said O’Murphy, looking out of
his hole, “the groom sent his jooty, an’ the pole av a
’bus had gone clane through the back panel av the broom
in a block off the Sthrand.... The horse kicked wan
av his four shoes off, an’ they’ve gone back wid themselves
to the stables to get the landau an’ pair——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Call a hansom,” said the plain little woman. “I—we
can’t wait here all night!”</p>

<p class='c009'>As O’Murphy saluted and went outside, she stepped
into his vacant hutch, and Gerry daringly followed.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>“If I might venture to offer,” he began. “My cab—place
disposal—Miss Speranza—too much honored——”
He trailed off into a morass of polite intentions, rudimentarily
expressed. The little companion maintained
a preoccupied air; she was probably expecting her mistress,
Gerry thought, but the conviction was no sooner
formed than banished.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are very kind,” she said, “but Miss Speranza
cannot avail herself of your offer. She sometimes leaves
quite early, and by the private door, and, as it happens,
I am going home alone.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” cried Gerry earnestly, “if you knew how
awfully I want to speak to you, you would let me drive
you there—wherever it is!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Tears stood in the soft eyes of the somewhat soft-headed
young man, and the heart of the little lady in the
ulster was softened, for she looked upon him with a
smile, saying:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here comes O’Murphy to say my hansom is waiting....
You may drive with me part of the way, and
say what you have to say, if it is so very important,”
she said, with a brilliant gleam of mockery in her remarkable
eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Need one say that the enamored Gerry jumped at
the proposal, and they went out into the plashy night
together.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Give the driver the address, O’Murphy,” ordered
the little ulstered woman. “Jump in!” she said to
Gerry, and, presto! they were rattling together up a
stony thoroughfare leading from the roaring midnight
Strand, which in the present year of grace presents a
smooth face of macadam.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will you have the glass down?” said Gerry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Too warm!” cried the little ulstered woman. “Now,
what have you to say?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How this trap rattles!” shouted Gerry. “One can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>hardly hear oneself speak. But with regard to Miss
Speranza——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose the pith of the matter is—you are in love
with her?” shrieked the little woman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Madly!” bellowed Gerry. “Been so for weeks.
Hold up, you brute!” This to the cab-horse, a dilapidated
equine wreck, which had stumbled.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, you boys! You’re all alike!” cried his companion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mine is a man’s love,” roared Gerry. “I would lay
the world at her feet, if I had it; and I want you to
tell her so.” The rattling of the crazy cab nearly
drowned his accents. “Oh! what do you think she will
say?” he bellowed, his lips close to the little woman’s
ear.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She would say—Oh! <em>do</em> you think this man is sober?”
screamed the little woman. “I mean the driver,”
she added, meeting Gerry’s indignant glare.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t think he is too drunk to drive,” yelled
Gerry. “Tell me, if you have a heart,” he howled, “have
I any chance <em>with her</em>?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! we’re off the cobblestones now!” said his companion,
leaning back with an air of relief.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you can answer my question,” pressed Gerry.
“I—I needn’t explain my views are honorable—straight
as a fellow’s can be. Love like mine is——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So dreadfully greasy!” commented his companion
anxiously, as the debilitated steed recovered himself
with difficulty at the end of a long slide.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When I have been sitting, night after night, in that
box looking at her, thinking of her, worshiping her,
by George!” went on Gerry, “she must have sometimes
noticed me, and said to herself——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I <em>knew</em> he would go down!” cried the little woman,
clutching Gerry’s arm, as the steed disappeared and the
shaft-ends bumped on the asphalt. “Let’s get out!”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>“Don’t be alarmed, lydy,” said a hoarse voice,
through the trap overhead, as the panting steed heaved
and struggled to regain his hoofs. “’E won’t do it agen
this journey. One fall is ’is allowance, an’ ’e never
goes beyond.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And we’re quite close to Pelgrave Square,” said
Gerry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How do you know Miss Speranza lives in Pelgrave
Square?” said his companion with a keen look.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because I’ve seen photogravings of her house in an
illustrated interview,” replied Gerry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, of course,” said the little lady, with a thoughtful
smile. The steed, bearing out his driver’s recommendation,
was now jogging along reassuringly enough. “And
did the portraits remind you of no one?” she added,
with another of those flashing smiles that invested her
little fatigued features with transient youth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They weren’t half beautiful enough for her,” said
Gerry fervently. Then a ray of light broke upon him,
and he jumped. “You—you’re a little bit like her!” he
exclaimed. “What a blind duffer I am! I’ve been taking
you for her companion, and all the while you’re a
relative.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I am a relative,” nodded the little lady.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Her aunt!” hazarded Gerry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Her mother!” said the little lady, with a dazzling
flash of eyes and teeth. “How stupid you were not to
guess it before!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve said nothing, madam, that I should not, I trust,”
remarked Gerry, with quite a seventeenth-century manner.
“And, therefore, when I entreat you to allow me
an interview with your daughter, I trust you will not
refuse to grant my—my prayer.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hear the boy!” cried the little woman, with a trill
of laughter, as the cab pulled up before a large lighted
house in a large darkish square. “Well,” she added, “I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>think I can promise you that Lottie will see you at least
for a minute or two to-morrow. Not here—at the theater,
seven o’clock sharp. Lend me a pencil and one of
your cards.” She scribbled a word or two on the bit
of pasteboard, paid the cab in spite of Gerry’s protestations,
and ran lightly up the solemn doorsteps, turned
to the enraptured young man standing, hat in hand, below,
waved her hand, plunged a Yale key into the keyhole—and
instantly vanished from view.</p>

<p class='c009'>Behind Gerry’s shirt-front throbbed tumultuous delight.
To have driven in a cab with <em>her</em> mother—talked
of <em>her</em>, told his tale of love—albeit with interruptions—and
won the promise of an interview at seven sharp
upon the morrow.... Unprecedented fortune! incomparable
luck! Did Time itself cease he would not fail
to keep the tryst with punctuality. He caught a passing
cab, drove home to his Piccadilly chambers, and went
to bed so blissfully happy that he spent a wretchedly
bad night. The card he kept beneath his pillow; and
true to the promise made by the mother of the enchantress
of his soul—when, punctually to the stroke
of seven, Gerry, dressed with the most excruciating care,
and clammy with repressed emotion, presented himself
at the stage door of the Levity—the scrawled hieroglyphics
on the blessed piece of pasteboard admitted him
behind the scenes. Led by a smartly-aproned maid, he
climbed stairs, he crossed the stage, was jostled by baize-aproned
men in paper caps, and begged their pardon.
He followed his guide down a short passage, fell up
three steps—and knocked with his burning brow against
the door—her door! A voice he knew said, “Come in!”
and in he went, to find, not the adored, the worshiped
Lottie, but the little plainish lady of the previous night,
sitting at a lace-veiled dressing-table, attired in a Japanese
gown.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I say!” murmured Gerry.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>“Ah! there you are!” The little lady looked at him
over her shoulder, and nodded kindly. “Don’t be too
disappointed at not finding Lottie here,” she said cheerfully;
“she won’t be long.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m so awfully obliged for all your kindness,” said
Gerry, sheepishly smiling over a giant bouquet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You shall be really grateful to me one of these days,
I promise you,” said the little lady. “Let my maid take
that haysta—that bouquet, and sit down, do!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gerry took the indicated chair beside the dressing-table,
and noted, as he sucked the top of his stick, how
pitilessly the relentless radiance of the electric light
accentuated the worn lines of the little lady’s face and
the gray streaks in her still soft and pretty brown hair.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cheer up!” she said, turning one of her flashing
smiles upon him as he sadly sucked his stick. “You
won’t have long to wait for Lottie!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No!” said Gerry rather vacuously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No!” said Lottie’s mother, pulling off some very
handsome rings and hanging them upon the horns of a
coral lobster that adorned the dressing-table. “She takes
about twenty minutes to make up.” Her pretty, white,
carefully-manicured fingers busied themselves, as she
talked, with various little pots and bottles and rolls of
a mysterious substance of a pinky hue, not unlike the
peppermint suck-stick of Gerry’s youth. “And are you
as much in love with her to-day,” she continued, “as you
were last night?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So much in love,” said Gerry, uncorking himself,
“that to call her my wife I would sacrifice everything.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To <em>call</em> her your wife?” The little lady pushed her
hair back from her face, twisted it tightly up behind,
and pinned it flat with a relentless hairpin.</p>

<p class='c009'>“To make her my wife,” Gerry amended, with a
healthy blush.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah!” said the little lady, who had covered her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>entire countenance, ears, and neck with a shiny mask
of pinkish paste. “A word makes such a difference.”
She dipped a hare’s-foot into a saucer of rouge, and
with this compound impartially, as it seemed to Gerry,
incarnadined her cheeks and chin. “Of course,” she
went on, dipping a disemboweled powder-puff into a
pot of French chalk and deftly applying it, “you are
aware that she possesses in years the advantage of
yourself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am twenty-three,” said Gerry proudly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She owns to more than that!” said the lovely Lottie’s
mother. She had reddened her mouth, hitherto obliterated
by the paste, into an alluring Cupid’s bow, and
darkened in, above her wonderfully brilliant eyes, a pair
of arch-provoking eyebrows. Now, as some inkling of
the fateful revelation in store clamped Gerry’s jaws
upon his stick and twined his legs in a death-grip about
the supports of his chair, she rapidly, with a blue pencil,
imparted to those brilliant eyes the Oriental languor,
the divinely alluring, almond-lidded droop that distinguished
Lottie’s, seized a tooth-brush, dipped it into a
bottle, apparently of liquid soot, rapidly blackened her
eyelashes, indicated with rose-pink a dimple on her chin,
groped for a moment in a cardboard box that stood
upon the ledge of her toilet table, produced a golden wig
of streaming tresses, dexterously assumed it, pulled here,
patted there, twisted a brow-tendril into shape—and
turning, shed upon the paralyzed Gerry the smile that
had enchained his heart.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I told you Lottie would not be long,” said Lottie,
“and I’ve made up under twenty minutes. You dear,
silly, honorable, romantic boy, don’t stare in that awful
way. Twenty-three indeed! And I told you I owned
to more! I ought to, for I have a son at Harrow, and
a daughter of seventeen besides.... Do try and shut
your mouth. Why, you poor dear goose, I was making
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>my bow to the boys in the gallery when you were playing
with a Noah’s Ark. Shake hands, and go round
in front and see me do my piece, as usual. I’ve got used
to that nice fresh face of yours up in Box B, and applause
is the breath of my nostrils, if I am old enough
to be your mother. Leave your flowers; my girl at
home has got quite to look out for them—and be off
with you, because this”—she indicated the French chalk—“has
got to go farther!” She gave Gerry her pretty
hand and one of the brilliant smiles, as he blundered
up from his chair, gasping apologies.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come and lunch with us to-morrow. You know my
address, and I’ve told the Professor all about you. You’ll
like the Professor—my husband. One of the best, though
his wife says it. And the children——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can I come in, mother?” said a clear voice outside.</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right, pet!” called back Gerry’s late goddess, and
a girl of seventeen came into the room. She was all
that Gerry had dreamed.... His frozen blood began
to thaw, and his tongue found words. Here was the
ideal.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But her name isn’t Lottie!” said his dethroned
goddess, with a twinkle of the wondrous eyes. “However,
you’re coming to lunch to-morrow, aren’t you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“With the greatest pleasure,” said Gerry. And as he
went round to his box he carefully obliterated the name
from the portrait cherished in his bosom for so many
weeks, with the intention of filling it in with another
to-morrow.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>THE REVOLT OF RUSTLETON</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>A new-comer joined the circle of attentive listeners
gathered round the easiest of all the easy-chairs in the
smoking-room of the Younger Sons’ Club. The surrounded
chair contained Hambridge Ost, a small, drab,
livery man, with long hair and drooping eyelids, who,
as cousin to Lord Pomphrey, enjoyed the immense but
fleeting popularity of the moment. Everyone panted
to hear the details of the latest Society elopement before
the newspapers should disseminate them abroad.
And Hambridge was not unwilling to oblige.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The first inkling of the general trend of affairs,
dear fellow,” said Hambridge, joining his long, pale
finger-tips before him, and smiling at the new-comer
across the barrier thus formed, “was conveyed to me
by an agitated ring at the telephone in my rooms. Bucknell,
my man, hello’ed. To Bucknell’s astonishment the
ring-up came from 000, Werkeley Square, the town
mansion of my cousin, Lord Pomphrey, which he knew
to be in holland covers and the care of an ex-housekeeper.
And Lady Pomphrey was the ringer. When
I hello’ed her, saying, ‘Are you there, Annabella? So
glad, but how unexpected; thought you were all enjoying
your <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">otium cum</span></i> down at Cluckham-Pomphrey’—my
cousin’s country-seat in Slowshire, dear fellow—such
a verbal flood of disjointed sentences came hustling
over the wire, so to speak, that I felt convinced, even
in the act of rubbing my ear, which tickled confoundedly,
that something was quite absolutely wrong somewhere.
Pomphrey—dear fellow!—was my first thought;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>then the Dowager—the ideal of a fine old Tory noblewoman
of ninety-eight, who may drop, so to put it,
any moment, dear creature, relieving her family of the
charge of paying her income and leaving the Dower
House vacant for Lord Rustleton, my cousin’s heir and
his—ahem!—bride. Knowing that Rustleton was to lead
the Hon. Celine Twissing to the altar of St. George’s,
Hanover Square, early in the Winter season, it occurred
to me, so to put it, that the demise of the Dowager could
not have occurred at a more auspicious moment. Thank
you, dear fellow, I <em>will</em> smoke one of your particular
Partagas, since you’re so good.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Four men struck vestas simultaneously as Hambridge
relieved the nicotian delicacy of its gold-and-scarlet cummerbund.
Another man supplied him with an ash-tray.
Yet another pushed a footstool under his pampered
patent-leathers. Exhaling a thin blue cloud, the Oracle
continued:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Amidst my distracted relative’s fragmentary utterances
I gleaned the name of Rustleton. Hereditary
weak heart—circulation as limited as that of a newspaper
which on strictly moral grounds declines to report
Divorce Cases—and a disproportionate secretion
of bile, so to put it, distinguishes him, dear fellow, from,
shall I say, mortals less favored by birth and of lower
rank. A vision of a hatchment over the door of 000,
Werkeley Square—of the entire population of the county
assisting at his obsequies, dear fellow—volted through
my brain. I seized my hat, and rushed from my chambers
in Ryder Street. An electric hansom had fortunately
pulled up in front of ’em. I jumped in. ‘Where
to?’ asked the chauffeur. ‘To a broken-hearted mother,’
said I, ‘000, Werkeley Square, and drive like the
dooce!’”</p>

<p class='c009'>Hambridge cleared his throat with some pomp, and
crossed his little legs comfortably. Then he went on:</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>“Like the Belgian sportsman, who, in missin’ a sittin’
hare, shot his father-in-law in the stomach, mine was
an effort not altogether wasted. All the blinds of the
house were down, and the hysterical shrieks of Lady
Pomphrey echoin’ through practically a desert of rolled-up
carpets and swathed furniture, had collected a small
but representative crowd about the area-railings. I
leaped out of the motor-cab, threw the chauffeur the legal
fare, and bein’ admitted to the house by an hysterical
caretaker, ascended to my cousin’s boudoir, the sobs
and shrieks of the distracted mother growing louder as
I went. Dear fellows, when Lady Pomphrey saw me,
heard me saying, ‘Annabella, I must entreat you as a
near relative to calm yourself sufficiently to tell me the
worst without delay, or to direct me to the nearest person
who can supply authentic information,’ the floodgates
of her sorrow were opened to such an extent that—possessing
a constitution naturally susceptible to damp—I
have had a deuce of a cold ever since.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lord Rustleton—always a nervous faddist, though
the dearest of fellows—Rustleton had suddenly broken
off his engagement to the Hon. Celine Twissing, only
child and heiress of Lord Twissing of Hopsacks, the colossal
financier figurehead, as I call him, of the Brewing
Trade. Naturally, the young man’s mother was crushed
by the blow. The marriage was to have been solemnized
at the opening of the Winter Season—the trousseau was
nearly ready, and the cake—a mammoth pile of elaborate
indigestion—was bein’ built up in tiers at Guzzards’.
The presents (includin’ a diamond and sapphire
bangle from a Royal source) had come in in shoals.
Nothing could be more confoundedly inopportune than
Rustleton’s decision. For all her muscularity—and she
is an unpleasantly muscular young woman—you’d marry
her yourself to-morrow did you get the chance, dear
fellow. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vous n’êtes pas dégoûté.</span></i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>“But Rustleton’s a difficult man—always was. His
personal appearance ain’t prepossessin’, but he is Somebody,
and looks it; d’ye foller me? You feel at once
that a long line of ancestors, more or less distinguished,
must have handed down the bilious tendency from father
to son. Originally—which goes to prove that first impressions
are the stronger—Lady Pomphrey tells me he
could not stand Celine Twissing, wouldn’t have her for
nuts, or at any price; but after the disaster to the
steam yacht <em>Fifi</em>—run down by a collier at her moorings
in Southampton Water, you recollect, when by pure
force of muscle Miss Twissing snatched Lord Rustleton
from a watery grave, so to put it—he seemed to cave
in, as it were, and the engagement was formally announced.
I thought his eye unsteady and his laugh hollow,
when, with the rest of the family, I proffered my
insignificant congratulations. On that occasion, dear fellow,
he gave me two fingers instead of one, which
amounts to a grip with him, and whispered to the effect
that there was no use in cryin’ over spilled milk—a
familiar saw which has sprung to my own lips at the most
inopportune moments.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Celine was undoubtedly in love. Her being in love,
so to put it, added immensely to Rustleton’s discomfort.
For the New Girl is, as well as a muscular being,
a strenuous creature, omnivorous in her appetite for
mental exercise, and from the latest theories in physics
to the morality of the newest Slavonic novelist Rustleton
was expected to range with her hour by hour. Her
mass of knowledge oppressed him, her inexhaustible
fund of argument exhausted him, her fiery enthusiasm
reduced him to a condition of clammy limpness which
was—I may say it openly—painful to witness. A backward
Lower boy and an impatient Head Master might
have presented such a spectacle. Thank you, I will take
a Vermouth, since you are so kind. But the boy, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>getting away for the holidays, had the advantage of
Rustleton, poor fellow!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Hambridge waited till the Vermouth came, and, sipping
the tonic fluid, continued:</p>

<p class='c009'>“These details, I need not say, were not culled from
Lady Pomphrey, but extracted from Rustleton, who had
rushed up to town and gone to earth at his Club, to the
consternation of the few waiters who were not taking
holidays at the seaside. Little by little I became master
of the facts of the case, which was one of disparity from
the outset. From the muscular as from the intellectual
point Celine Twissing had always overshadowed her <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fiancé</span></i>.
But Celine’s intimate knowledge of the mode of conduct
necessary—I quote herself—to sane living and clear
thinking positively appalled him. Rustleton began the
day with hot Vichy water, dry toast, weak tea, and a
tepid immersion. <em>She</em>, Miss Twissing, commenced with
Indian clubs, a three-quarter-mile sprint in sweaters,
coffee, eggs, cold game-pie, ham, jam, muffins, and marmalade.
Did she challenge the man, to whom she was
soon to pledge lifelong obedience at the altar, to a single
at lawn-tennis, she quite innocently served him twisters
that he could only follow with his eye, and volleyed balls
that infallibly hit it. At croquet she was a scientist,
winning the game by the time Lord Rustleton had got
through three hoops, and coming back to stand by his
side and goad him to silent frenzy by criticism of his
method. She is a red-hot motorist, and insisted upon
taking Rustleton, wrapped in fur coats, and protected
by goggles, as passenger in the back seat of her sixty-horse-power
‘Gohard’ when she competed in the Crooklands
Circular Track One Thousand Mile Platinum Cup
Race, for private owners only, professional drivers
barred; and upon my honor, I believe she would have
pulled up the winner and heroine of the hour had not
the racing diet of bananas, meat jujubes, and egg-nog
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>created such a revolt in Rustleton’s system, poor fellow,
that at the sixth hour of the ordeal he was borne, almost
insensible, and bathed in cold perspiration, from the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tonneau</span></i> to a neighboring hotel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“To anxiety, in combination with exploding tires, I
attribute the fact of Miss Twissing’s finishing as Number
Four. Dear fellow, since you are so good as to
insist, I <em>will</em> put that cushion behind the small of my
back. Lumbago, in damp weather, is my particular
bane. Thankee!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Hambridge drew forth a spotlessly white handkerchief,
flourished it, and trumpeted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now we come to the crux, dear fellows. The Admirable
Twissing, as many call her, not content with bein’
an acknowledged expert in salmon fishin’ and a darin’
rider to hounds, set her heart on Rustleton’s being practically
the same. With a light trout-rod and a tin of
worms he <em>has</em> occasionally amoosed himself on locally-preserved
waters; mounted on an easy-goin’ cob, he is,
so to put it, fairly at home. Scotch and Norwegian rivers
now, shall I say, claimed him as their sacrifice; highly-mettled
hunters—the Hopsacks stables are famous—took
five-barred gates and quickset hedges with him; occasionally
even bolted with him, regardless of his personal
predilections. In the same spirit his betrothed bride
compelled him to fence with her; instructed him, at
severe physical expense to himself, in the rules of jiu-jitsu.
The final straw was laid upon the camel’s back
when she insisted on his putting on the gloves with her,
and standing up for half an hour every morning to
be scientifically pummeled.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The listeners’ mouths screwed themselves into the
shape of long-expressive whistles. Glances of profound
meaning were exchanged. One man said, with a gulp
of sympathy, “<em>Poor</em> beggar!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And so the worm turned,” said Hambridge Ost,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>running his forefinger round inside the edge of his collar.
“Smarting from upper-cuts administered by the
woman who was destined ere long to become the wife of
his bosom, flushed from having his head in Chancery,
gravely embarrassed by body-blows, dazzled by stars
and stripes seen as the result of merciless punches received
upon the nose, Rustleton summoned all his courage
to the effort, and declined to take any more lessons.
Miss Twissing, to do her justice, was thunderstruck.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Oh!’ she said, her lips quivering—like a hurt
child’s, according to Rustleton—‘and you were coming
on so <em>capitally</em>—we were getting on so well. You are
really gaining a knowledge of good boxing principles,
you were actually benefiting by our light little friendly
spars.’ Rustleton felt his nose, which was painfully
swollen. ‘Of course, you could never, never become a
first-rater. Your poor little muscles are too rigid. You
haven’t the strength to hit a print of your knuckles
into a pound of butter, but you might come to show
form enough to funk a big duffer, supposing he went
for you under the impression that you were as soft as
you look. But, of course, if you mean what you say’—she
pulled her gloves off and threw them into a corner
of the gymnasium at Hopsacks specially fitted up for
her by a noted firm—‘there they go. I’ll read the
Greek Anthologists with you instead, or’—her eyes
brightened—‘have you ever tried polo?’ she asked. ‘We
have some trained ponies in the stable, and the largest
croquet-lawn could be utilized for a ground, and I’ll
wire to the County Players for clubs and a couple of
members to teach us the rules of the game. You’ll like
that?’</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘I’m dashed if I shall!’ were the actual words that
burst, so to put it, from Rustleton. Celine drew herself
up and looked him over, from the feet upwards, as
though she had never, so he says, seen him before. Five
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>feet five—his actual height—gave her an advantage of
five inches and a bit over. He begged her to be seated,
and, standing before her in as dignified an attitude
as it is possible to assume in a light suit of gymnasium
flannels, with sawdust in your hair and a painfully
swollen nose, he broke the ice and demanded his release
from their engagement, saying that he felt it incumbent
on him to live his own life in his own way, that Celine
crushed, humiliated, and oppressed him by the mere
vigor of her intellect and the exuberance of her physical
personality—with considerably more to the same
effect.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She looked up when Rustleton, almost breathless,
reached a full stop. ‘You give me your word of honor
that there is no other woman in the case,’ she murmured;
‘I <em>can</em> stand your not loving me, I <em>can’t</em> your loving
somebody else better.’ As Rustleton gave the required
denial—scouted the bare idea—a tear ran down her
cheek and dropped on her large powerful arms, which
were folded upon her bust—really amazing, dear fellow,
and one of her strong points. ‘That settles it,’ she
uttered. ‘It’s understood, all’s off between us; you are
free. And there is a through express to London at
3:25. But I’m afraid I must detain you a moment
longer.’ She rang the bell, and told a servant to tell
Professor Pudsey she was wanted in the gym. ‘Tell
her to come in sparring kit, and be quick about it,’ were
her actual words.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Until the Professor appeared, Miss Twissing chatted
quite pleasantly with Rustleton. The Professor was a
large, flat-faced woman, of remarkable muscular development,
with her hair coiled in a tight knob at the back
of her head, her massive form attired in a thin jersey,
short serge skirt, long stockings, and light gymnasium
shoes. ‘Let me introduce my friend and resident instructress
in boxing, fencing, and athletics,’ says Celine,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>‘and one of the best, so to put it, that ever put a novice
through his paces. Celebrated as the wife and trainer of
the late Ponto Pudsey, Heavy-weight Champion of England,
and holder of the Hyam’s Competition Belt three
seasons running until beat by Bat Collins at the International
Club Grounds in ’92. Pudsey dear’—she
turned to the Professor—‘you know my little way when
I’ve had a set-back. Instead of playing <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le diable à
quatre</span></i> and being disagreeable and cantankerous all
round, I simply send for you and say, as I say now,
“Put up your hands, and do your best; I warn you
I’m going in for a regular slugging match under the
rules of the Amateur Boxing Association. Three rounds—the
first and second of three minutes’ length, the third
of four minutes’. This gentleman will act as time-keeper,
and pick up whichever of us gets knocked out. He has
plenty of time before he catches the express to town—and
the lesson will be good for him.”’ She and the
Professor shook hands, and, with heads erect, mouths
firmly closed, eyes fixed, left toes straight, bodies evenly
balanced, left arms workin’ loosely, rights well across
mark, and so forth, started business in the most thorough-goin’
way. Such a bout of fisticuffs—accordin’ to
Rustleton—you couldn’t behold outside the American
prize-ring.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“By—Jingo!” ejaculated one of the listeners.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They led off in a perfectly scientific manner at the
head, guarded and returned, retreated and advanced,
ducked, feinted, countered, and cross-countered,” said
Hambridge Ost, “until Rustleton grew giddy. Terrific
hits were given and taken before he could command
himself sufficiently to call ‘Time,’ the Professor with a
black eye, Celine with a cut lip, both of ’em smilin’ and
self-possessed to an astonishin’ degree; went in again
at the end of the brief breathin’ space, and fairly outdid
the previous round. When a smashin’ knock-out on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>the point of the jaw finally floored the Professor and
she failed to come up to time, leavin’ Miss Twissing
mistress of the gory field, Celine nodded significantly to
Rustleton, and said, as she rolled down her sleeves, ‘That
would have been for <em>you</em>, Russie, old boy, if there had
been another woman in the case. As there isn’t—goodbye,
and good luck go with you! I’m going to put dear
old Pudsey to bed, and plaster this cut lip of mine.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I like that girl!” declared the man who had said
“By Jingo!” “A rattling good sort, I call her. But
a punch-bag would have done as well as the Professor,
I should have thought.” He tugged at his mustache
and wrinkled his forehead thoughtfully. “A damaged
lip is so fearfully disfiguring. Has it quite healed?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know nothing of Miss Twissing,” said Hambridge,
settling his necktie, “and desire to know nothing of that
very unfeminine young person, who, I feel sure, would
have been as good as her word and pounded Rustleton
into a human jelly, had she been aware that there actually
existed, if I may so put it, an adequate feminine
reason for the dear fellow’s—shall I say, change of
mind?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course,” said the man who had been anxious
about Miss Twissing’s lip, “the little bounder—beg pardon!
Of course, Rustleton was telling a colossal howler.
As all the world knows, or will know when the newspapers
come out to-morrow, there was another woman
in the case.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Petsie Le Poyntz,” put in another voice, “of the
West End Theater. Petsie of the lissom—ahem!—limbs,
of the patent mechanical smile—mistress of the wink that
convulses the gallery, and inventor of the kick that enraptures
the stalls. Petsie, who has won her way into
what Slump, of the <cite>Morning Gush</cite>, calls the ‘peculiar
favor of the British playgoer,’ by her exquisite and
spontaneous rendering of the ballad, ‘Buzzy, Buzzy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>Busy Bee,’ sung nightly and at two <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">matinées</span></i> per week
in <cite>The Charity Girl</cite>. Petsie, once the promised bride of
a thriving young greengrocer, now——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, Viscountess Rustleton,” said Hambridge Ost.
“Don’t forget that, dear fellow, pray. I can conceive,
even while I condemn my cousin’s ill-considered action
in taking to his—shall I say bosom? yesterday morning
at the Registrar’s—a young lady of obvious gifts and
obscure parentage without letting his family into the
secret—that he found her a soothing change from Miss
Twissing. No Greek, no athletics, no strenuousness of
any kind. An appearance distinctly pleasing, even off
the boards, a certain command of repartee of the ‘You’re
another’ sort, an agreeable friskiness varied by an inclination
to lounge languidly—and there you have Petsie,
dear fellow. The weddin’ breakfast took place at the
Grill Room of the Savoy Hotel, the extra-sized table,
number three, at the east upper end against the glass
partition havin’ been specially engaged by the management
of the West End Theater. That, not bein’ an
invited guest, I ascertained from the waiter who
usually looks after me when I lunch there. The <em>menu</em>
was distinctly a good ’un. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hors d’œuvres</span></i> ... a bisque,
follered by <em>turban de turbot</em>.... Birds with bread-cream
sauce, chipped potatoes, tomatoes stuffed, and a
corn salad. Chocolate <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">omelette soufflée</span></i>—ices in the shape
of those corrugated musk melons with pink insides, figs,
and nectarines. Of course, a claret figured—Château-Nitouche;
but, bein’ a theatrical entertainment, the Boy
washed the whole thing down. The name of the liqueur
I did not get hold of.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Parfait Amour</span></i>, perhaps?” said a feeble voice, with
a faint chuckle.</p>

<p class='c009'>“As I have said, I failed to ascertain,” returned Hambridge
Ost, with a dry little cough. “But as Lord
Pomphrey, justly indignant with his heir for throwing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>over Miss Twissing, with whose hand goes a colossal fortune,
has practically reduced his income to a mere”—he
elevated his eyebrows and blew a speck of cigar-ash
from his coat-sleeve—“<em>that</em>—the stirrup-cup that sped
my cousin and his bride upon their wedding journey
was certainly not, shall I say, <em>Aqua d’Oro?</em>”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a faint chorus of applause. Hambridge,
repressing all sign of triumph, smoothed his preternaturally
sleek head and uncrossed his little legs preparatory
to getting out of his chair. The circle of listeners melted
away; the man who had said “By Jingo!” straightened
his hat carefully, staring at the reflection of a distinctly
good-looking face in the mantel-glass.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If she had known—if that girl Celine Twissing had
known—the game that bilious little rotter meant to
play, he’d have had his liqueur before his soup, and it
would have been punch—not Milk Punch or Turtle
Punch, but the real thing, with trimmings.” He arranged
a very neat mustache with care. “Sorry she
got her lip split,” he murmured; “hope it’s healed all
right.... Waiter, get me a dozen Sobranie cigarettes.
It’s a pity, a confounded pity, that the only man who
is really able to appreciate that grand girl Celine Twissing
happens to be a younger son. But, anyhow, I can
have a shot at her, and I will.”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>A DYSPEPTIC’S TRAGEDY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“He is a constant visitor,” observed Lady Millebrook.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And a constant friend,” said Mrs. Tollebranch. A
delicate flush mantled on her otherwise ivory cheek, her
great gray eyes, famed for their far-away, saintly expression,
shone through a gleaming veil of tears. With
the lithe, undulating movement so characteristic of her,
she crossed the velvety carpets to the window, and, lifting
a corner of her silken blind, peeped out over her
window-boxes of jonquils as the hall-door closed, and a
well-dressed man with a slight stoop and a worn, dyspeptic
countenance went slowly down the doorsteps and
got into his cab. As though some subtle magnetic thrill
had conveyed to him the knowledge that fair eyes looked
on his departure, he glanced up and bowed, for one
moment becoming a younger man, as a temporary glow
suffused his pallid features. Then the cab drove off, and
Mrs. Tollebranch, slipping her hand within the arm of
Lady Millebrook, drew her back to her cosy seat within
the radius of the fire-glow, and rang for tea.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I did not have it up while poor Cadminster was
here,” she explained. “The sight of Sally Lunn is horrible
to him, and he is positively forbidden tea.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They say,” said Lady Millebrook, nibbling the Sally
Lunn, “that he lives upon gluten biscuits, lean boiled
mutton, and white fish, washed down by weak Medoc,
mixed with hot water.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is true,” returned her friend.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And yet he dines out. I meet him comparatively
often at other people’s tables,” said Lady Millebrook.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>“And here—invariably.” Her eyebrows wore the
crumple of interrogation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The servants have orders to pass him over,” explained
Mrs. Tollebranch, sipping her tea. “If Jerks
or Wilbraham were to offer him a made dish, one, if
not both of them, would be instantly dismissed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear Clarice! Friendship is friendship....
But Jerks and Wilbraham.... Such invaluable servants!
You cannot mean what you say!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do mean it,” nodded Mrs. Tollebranch. “Oh, Bettine!”
she murmured, clasping Lady Millebrook’s hand,
“don’t look so surprised. If you only knew how much
that man has sacrificed for me!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If there is anything upon which I pride myself,”
observed Lady Millebrook, “it is my absolute lack of
curiosity. And yet people are always telling me their
secrets—the most intimate, the most important! ‘Bettine,’
they say, ‘you are a Grave!’ ... So I am; it is
quite true. A thing once repeated in my hearing is
buried for ever! We have not known each other very
long, it is true, but you must have discovered that I am
absolutely reliable! Talking of sacrifices, there are so
many sorts. Now perhaps in your gratitude for this
service rendered you by Lord Cadminster, you overrate.
Perhaps it is really not so great as you imagine! Perhaps...!
But I am not curious in the least!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Would it surprise you to hear,” queried Mrs. Tollebranch,
“that Cadminster, two years ago, was <em>perfectly
healthy!</em> Not the cadaverous dyspeptic he is now; not
the semi-invalid, but a robust, healthy, fresh-colored
man of the out-of-doors, hardy English type?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lady Millebrook elevated her eyebrows. “Dear me,”
she observed. “How very odd! And now—you know
his horrid <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soubriquet</span></i>—‘The Boiled Owl.’ He has earned
it <em>since</em>, of course.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He had a splendid appetite once,” continued Mrs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>Tollebranch, “an iron constitution—a perfect digestion.
He gave them all three to save a woman’s honor.
Oh! Bettine, can you guess who the woman was?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I never hazard guesses about my friends,” said the
inexorable Lady Millebrook. “But I feel, somehow, that
she may have been you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was weak,” admitted Mrs. Tollebranch, clasping
her friend’s hand with agitated jeweled fingers. “But
not wicked, Bettine. Promise me to believe that!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I never promise,” said Bettine, “but no one could
look at you and doubt that ... whatever you might do,
would be the outcome of irresistible impulse, <em>not</em> the
result of deliberate—ahem! My dearest, you interest
me indescribably,” she cried, “and if I were the <em>least
bit</em> inclined to curiosity, I am sure I should implore you
to go on.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You shall hear the story of Cadminster’s Great Sacrifice,
Bettine,” said Mrs. Tollebranch, “and when you
have heard, you will regard him——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“As Bayard and all the other heroes of chivalry rolled
into one, and dressed by a Bond Street tailor,” interrupted
Lady Millebrook, with a glow of impatience in
her fine dark eyes. “I think you mentioned two years
ago?” she added, settling a little stray lock of her
friend’s silken blonde hair, and sinking back among
her cushions.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Two years ago,” murmured Mrs. Tollebranch, “Willibrand
became bitten with the Golf Spider. He is as
wild about the game to-day,” she added, “as ever.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is a proverb, ‘Once a golfer, always a golfer,’”
put in Lady Millebrook. “I believe that to play the
game successfully requires a vast amount of thought and
judgment, which insensibly diverts a man’s mind from
less harmless topics, and that it entails an invigorating
and healthy action of the arms and legs, soothing to the
nervous system, and improving in its effect upon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>temper. Were I asked by any married woman of my
acquaintance whether she should encourage her husband
in his devotion to golf, or dissuade him from it, I should
advise her to encourage the fad. The game, unlike
others, can be played all the year round, in sunshine,
rain, or snow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Willibrand used to play it in the snow,” put in
Mrs. Tollebranch, “with red balls. It was when we were
spending March at Tobermuirie two years ago, that——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That Lord Cadminster performed the chivalrous action
which resulted for him in the permanent loss of his
digestion? Well?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tobermuirie is the bleakest spot in North Britain,”
began Mrs. Tollebranch, returning the teacups to the
tray, and touching the electric bell in a manner which
conveyed the intimation that she would not be at home
to any caller for the next quarter of an hour. “The
castle is one of the oldest inhabited residences in Europe,
and, I verily believe, the coldest. If you would
like to find out for yourself how easily a northern gale
can penetrate walls ten feet thick in the thinnest places,
come to us in July.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall make a point of it!” said Lady Millebrook,
cuddling down into her warm, scented lair of
cushions.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course, the male division of the house-party was
made up of golfing enthusiasts,” went on Mrs. Tollebranch.
“Major Wharfling, Sir Roger Balcombe, Cadminster,
who was as keen as Willibrand in those days,
three Guardsmen, and D’Arsy Pontoise.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“By the way, what has become of Pontoise?” queried
Lady Millebrook. “One never meets him now as one
used.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He scarcely ever leaves Paris, I believe,” returned
Mrs. Tollebranch, rather constrainedly. “Since his reconciliation
with the Duc, his great-uncle, and his marriage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>with Mademoiselle De Carapoix, who I have heard
is a very strict Catholic and humpbacked——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Besides being a great heiress.... Of course, he is
kept well within bounds. But what a fascinating creature
Pontoise used to be. Bubbling with life, effervescing
with spirits. Sadly naughty, too, I fear, for the names
of at least half a dozen pretty married women used to
be mixed up with his in all sorts of scan.... My dearest,
I beg your pardon!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I, at least, was not wicked—only weak!” said Clarice,
with icy dignity. “And as to there being five
others——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My sweet, it was the vaguest hearsay. Nothing certain,
except that Pontoise spoke perfect English and was
a veritable Apollo! I can imagine the rigors of imprisonment
in a Border castle in March to have been ameliorated
by the fact of his being a guest under its aged
roof. Did he play golf?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Tollebranch rose and took a dainty screen of
crimson feathers from the high mantelshelf.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He tried to learn,” she explained, holding the screen
so as to shield her delicate complexion from the glowing
heat of the log fire. “But the game baffled him. To
play it properly, I believe, the mind must be dead to
all other interests——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And Pontoise’s mind was unusually alive at that
particular moment to things outside the sphere of golf,”
mused Lady Millebrook. “Golf is a game for husbands,
not for——” Her red lips closed on the unuttered word.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t say, ‘lovers’!” implored Clarice. “From beginning
to end, Bettine, it was nothing but a flirtation.
I will own that I was—attracted, almost fascinated. I
had never met a human being whose nature was of so
many colors ... whose soul....” She broke off.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have been informed on good authority,” observed
Lady Millebrook, “that whenever Pontoise meant mischief
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>he invariably talked about his soul. But do go
on!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course, you played golf also; and as one of the
great advantages connected with the game is that you
can choose your own partner, I may presume that Pontoise
made acquaintance with it under your auspices, and
that when he landed himself in the jaws of some terrific
sand-bunker, you were at hand to help him out.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“As his hostess, it was rather incumbent upon me,”
explained Mrs. Tollebranch, “to make myself of use.
Willibrand and Sir Roger Balcombe termed him a duffer;
Major Wharfling is nothing but a professional, Cadminster
and the Guardsmen were hard drivers all. And
as Bluefern had made me a golfing costume which was
a perfect dream——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You completed the conquest of Pontoise. I quite
understand!” said Bettine. “In that frock, armed with
a long spoon. I quite grasp it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The golf course is very open at Tobermuirie,” went
on Clarice, playing with the feather fan.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But there are hillocks, and bumps and boulders, and
things behind which Pontoise managed to get in a good
many references to his soul. I grasp <em>that</em> also,” observed
Lady Millebrook.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He did mention his soul,”  admitted Mrs. Tollebranch.
“He said that it had always been lonely, thirsting for
the sympathy of a sister-spirit until——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Until he met you!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He did say as much. And he explained how, in
sheer desperation of ever meeting the affinity, the flame
for whom the spark of his being had been originally
kindled, a man may drift into all kinds of follies, even
gain the name of a libertine and a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">roué</span></i>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Quite true.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He has such wonderful eyes, like moss agates, and
his profile is like the Hermes of Praxiteles, or would be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>but for the waxed mustache and crisp, golden beard.
And there is a vibrating <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">timbre</span></i> in his voice that goes
to the very heart. One could not but be sorry for him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am sure you were very sorry indeed. But Pontoise,
as one knows of him, would not long be content with
that. Your heartfelt pity, and the tip of your little
finger to kiss....” Lady Millebrook’s sleepily dark
eyes smiled cynical amusement. “Those things are the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors d’œuvres</span></i> of flirtation. Soup, fish, made-dishes,
roast, and sweets invariably succeed, with black coffee
and a subsequent indigestion.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Clarice avoided the glance of this feminine philosopher.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pontoise was always respectful,” she said, with a
little note of defiance in her voice. “He never forgot
what was due to me save once, when——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“When it was borne in upon him too strongly what
he owed to himself. And then he kissed you, and you
were furiously angry.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Furious!” nodded Clarice, brushing her round chin
with the edge of the crimson screen. “I vowed I would
never speak to him again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And how long did you keep that oath?” asked Bettine.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We met at dinner in the evening, and of course one
has to be civil. And when I went to bed, and he handed
me my candlestick,” said Mrs. Tollebranch—“for gas
is only laid as high as the first floor of the castle, and
the electric light has never been heard of—he slipped
a note into my hand. It implored my pardon, and declared
that unless I would meet him in the golf-house
on the links next day before lunch, and receive his profound
apologies, he would terminate an existence which
my well-deserved scorn had rendered insupportable. He
spoke of the—the——” Clarice hesitated.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The kiss,” put in Lady Millebrook, “and——”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>“Said he had dared, in a moment of insanity, to
desecrate the cheek of the purest woman breathing with
lips that ought to be branded for their criminal presumption.
He could never atone, he ended, but he could
never forget.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And asked you in the postscript to meet him in the
golf-house. I quite understand,” observed Lady Millebrook.
“Of course, you didn’t go?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Clarice’s lovely gray-blue eyes opened. Her sensitive
lips quivered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! but I am afraid....” She heaved a little regretful
sigh over her past folly. “That is where I was
weak, Bettine. I went. Oh, don’t laugh!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My child, this is hysteria,” explained Lady Millebrook,
removing the filmy handkerchief from her lovely
eyes. “Well—you went. You popped your head into
the lion’s mouth—and somehow or other Cadminster
played the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">deus ex machina</span></i>, and got it out for you
again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The golf-house was a queer shanty, with a tarred
roof,” said Mrs. Tollebranch retrospectively. “It held a
bunker of coals, and stands for clubs, and a fireplace,
and a folding luncheon-table, and camp-stools, and hampers.
We used to lunch outside when it didn’t rain or
snow, and inside when it did. Well, when Willibrand
and Sir Roger Balcombe, Major Wharfling, the Guardsmen,
and Cadminster were quite out of sight, Pontoise
and I somehow found ourselves back at the golf-house.
I was cold, and there was a fire there, and he looked so
handsome and so miserable as he stood bare-headed by
the door, waiting for me to enter, that——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The fly walked in. And then the spider——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He disappointed me, I will own,” said Clarice, with
a little gulp. “After all his penitent protestations! I
have never trusted men with agate-colored eyes since,
and I never will. They have only one idea of women,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>and that is—the worst. But when I ordered him to let
go my hands and get up from his knees, something in
my face or voice seemed to tell him that I was really,
really, in earnest, and he obeyed me, and moved suddenly
away as I went to the door. The latch rattled as I lifted
my hand, the door opened; Cadminster stood there,
white from head to foot, for a sudden blizzard had swept
down from the hills, and the links were four inches
deep in snow. Oh! I shall never forget how tactful he
was! ‘You have got here before the rest of us!’ he said,
quite in a cheery, ordinary way. ‘Lucky for you! Tollebranch
and the others are coming after me as hard as
they can pelt, and we shall have to put out the “House
Full” boards in a minute.’ And he began to rattle out
the flaps of the luncheon-table, and get out things from
the hamper, and then he looked at me, and said, as he
lifted the lid from a great kettle of Irish stew that had
been simmering over the fire, ‘Suppose you were to take
the ladle and give this mess a bit of a stir, Mrs. Tollebranch!
The fire will burn your face, I’m afraid, but
what woman wouldn’t sacrifice her complexion in the
cause of duty?’ Oh, Bettine, I could have blessed Cadminster
as I seized that iron ladle, for seeming so natural
and at ease. And then—almost before I had begun
to stir the stew—while I was bending over the pot,
Willibrand and the other men came in. What followed
I can never forget!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now we come to Cadminster’s great act of heroism?”
interrogated Lady Millebrook.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Willibrand came in stamping the snow off,” went
on Mrs. Tollebranch. “So did all the other men. Willibrand
sniffed the odor of the oniony stew with rapture.
All the other men sniffed too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The tastes of the male animal are extraordinarily
simple,” observed Lady Millebrook, “in spite of the elaborate
pretense carried on and kept up by him, of being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>a gourmand and a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">connoisseur</span></i>. The coarsest dishes are
those which appeal most irresistibly to his palate, and
when I find it necessary for any length of time to chain
Millebrook to his home, I order a succession of barbaric
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">plats</span></i>. By the time we have reached tripe and onions,
served as an <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entrée</span></i>, there is not a more domesticated
husband breathing. But pray continue.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They all assembled round the stewpot,” went on
Clarice, “and watched with absorbed interest the operation
of turning its steaming contents into the dish that
awaited them. Cadminster and Willibrand undertook
this duty. Well——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just as they heaved up the steaming cauldron, Willibrand
called out, ‘Hulloa, what the deuce is that?’ His
hands were occupied—he could not get at his eyeglass,”
said Mrs. Tollebranch, “and so he peered and exclaimed,
while I leaned over his shoulder and glanced into the
stewpot. There, floating upon the surface of the muttony,
oniony, carroty, potatoey mass, was”—she shuddered—“the
letter Pontoise had given me with my candlestick
on the preceding night!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My <em>dear</em>, how awful!” gasped Lady Millebrook.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I had had it in my pocket,” explained Mrs. Tollebranch,
“when I arrived at the golf-house. When I began
to stir the stew I found the handle of the ladle too
hot to be pleasant, and I pulled out my handkerchief to
wrap round it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Whisking Pontoise’s effusion out with it! How reckless
not to have burned it!” cried Lady Millebrook.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Imagine my feelings!” said Clarice. “There was
the letter in the stewpot. As the contents were turned
by Cadminster into the dish, I lost sight of the envelope
beneath a greasy avalanche of fat mutton and vegetables.
I remembered that Pontoise had referred to that unlucky
kiss; I recalled Willibrand’s unfortunate tendency
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>to outbursts of jealous rage without reason; I shuddered
at the thought of the amount of reason that envelope
contained. Self-control abandoned me—my brain spun
round, I thought all lost ... and then—I caught Cadminster’s
eye. There was encouragement in it—and
hope. ‘Trust to me,’ it said, ‘I will save you!’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And——?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We sat down to table, and that stew was distributed,
in large portions, to all those men. Cadminster assumed
control of the ladle. He gravely asked me whether
I cared about stew, and I gasped out something—what
I don’t know, but I believe I said I didn’t. When the
words were out, I knew that I had lost my only chance—that
Cadminster had intended to help me to that fatal
envelope. My fate hung in the balance as he filled plate
after plate.... Who would get my letter in his gravy,
amongst his vegetables? What would happen then?
Would it be rendered illegible by grease, or would it not?
I scarcely breathed, the suspense was so awful!” said
Mrs. Tollebranch, clutching Lady Millebrook’s sleeve.
“And then—Relief came. I grasped that man’s heroic
motive—I understood the full nobility of his nature
when——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“When Cadminster helped himself to the letter! But,
good heavens! you don’t mean to tell me,” cried Lady
Millebrook, “that he <em>ate</em> it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He did, he did!” cried Mrs. Tollebranch, throwing
herself into her friend’s sympathetic embrace. “Now
you know why I call him a Bayard, and look upon him
as my truest, noblest friend. Now you know....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why he is a cadaverous dyspeptic! Of course. That
document must have completely wrecked his constitution.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It has,” interrupted Clarice, with a little shower of
tears.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall never say again,” remarked Lady Millebrook,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>as she took an affectionate leave of her dearest friend
but four, “that Romance and Chivalry have no existence
in these modern times. To jump into a den full of lions
and things to get a lady’s bracelet or save a lady’s glove
may sound finer, though I am not sure. But to eat
another man’s love-letter, envelope and all, to save a
woman’s reputation ... there is the true ring of heroism
about it, the glow that ennobles an ordinary, commonplace
action into something superb. And, unless I
mistake, Pontoise invariably penned his amatory effusions
upon the very stiffest of parchment wove.... Darling,
Lord Cadminster must dine with us.... Next
Thursday; I will not take No!” ended Lady Millebrook;
“and he may rely upon it that if either Jedbrook or
Mills presume to offer him anything rich or oleaginous,
either or both of them will be dismissed next day!”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>RENOVATION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The hands of the Dresden clock upon the white travertine
mantelshelf of Lady Sidonia’s boudoir pointed
to the small hours. There was a discreet knock at the
door. The maid, a pale, pretty young woman, who was
wielding the hair-brush, laid the weapon down, and answered
the knock.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who is it, Pauline?” asked Pauline’s mistress, with
her eyes upon the mirror, which certainly framed a
picture well worth looking at.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Her Grace’s maid, my lady, asking whether you are
too tired for a chat?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Say that I shall be delighted, and give me the blue
Japanese kimono instead of this pink thing. Will my
hair do? Because, if it needs no more brushing, you
can go to bed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you, my lady.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The door opened; trailing silks swept over the carpet....</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t kiss you through all this brown-gold silk,”
said the Duchess’s voice. “Stop, though! You shall
have it on the top of your head.” And the kiss descended,
light as a puff of thistle-down. “I kiss Cull
there sometimes, when I want him to be in a good temper.
He says it thrills right down to the tips of his
toes.... You’re smiling! I guess you think the stock
of thrills ought to be exhausted by this time—three years
since we stood up together on the deck of Cluny F.
Farradaile’s anchored airship, a posse of detectives from
Blueberry Street guarding the ends of the fore and aft
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>cables, where they were anchored three hundred feet
below in the grounds of the N’York Æther Club, just
to prevent any one of the dozens of Society girls who’d
tried their level best to catch Cull and failed, from
coming along with a bowie and cutting ’em.... You
remember the pars. in all the papers, headed, ‘A Marriage
Made in Heaven,’ I guess?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course, of course,” said the Duchess’s hostess and
dearest friend.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My invention,” said her Grace, “and mighty smart,
I reckon. I’d always said I’d be married in a real original
way—and I was. The only drawback to the affair
was that she pitched—I mean the airship—and the Minister,
and Cull, and Poppa, and the inventor—that’s
Cluny F. Farradaile—were taken poorly before the close
of the cer’mony. As for my sex, I’m proud to say that
Amurrican women can rise superior even to air-sickness
when Paris frocks are in question. But when they
wound us down we were glad enough to get back to dry
land. We found a representative of the Customs waiting
for us, by the way; and if Poppa hadn’t gone to
law about it, and proved that we were really fixed on to
the States by our cables, we’d have had to plank down
the duty on every jewel we’d got on. Say, pet, I’m
perishing for a smoke!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Duchess was supplied with cigarettes. Pauline
placed upon a little table the materials that “factorize,”
as the Duchess would have said, towards the composition
of cognac and soda, and glided out.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now I call that a real pretty, meek-looking creature,”
said her Grace, blowing a little flight of smoke
rings in the direction of the door. “If she’s as clever as
she’s nice, Siddie, you’ve got a treasure!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She <em>is</em> a good maid,” responded Lady Sidonia. “For
one thing, she knows a great deal about the toilette, and
on the subject of the complexion she’s really quite an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>authority. She knows something of massage, too—on the
American system—for, though an English girl, she has
lived in your country——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” said the Duchess, with an accent of interest.
“Has she, indeed?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’s reasonable, too,” went on the maid’s mistress;
“and not a limpet in the way of sticking to one mode of
doing the hair and refusing to learn any other. Then
she can <em>wave</em>——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is an accomplishment,” said the Duchess thoughtfully.
“Now, my woman either frizzes you like a Fiji,
or leaves you dank and straight like a mermaid. Why
does hair never wave naturally—out of a novel? It’s a
question for a Convention. And men—dear idiots!—are
such believers in the reality of ripples. There! I’ve
been implored over and over again for ‘just that little
bit with the wave in it’ to keep in a locket—hundreds
and hundreds of times. I guess Cull’s wiser now; but
once you’ve seen your husband’s teeth in a tumbler,
you’ve entered into a Conjugal Reciprocity Convention:
‘Believe in me—not as much of me as really belongs to
me, but as much as you see—and I’ll return the compliment!’
Yes, I guess I’ll take some S. and B. It’s an
English accomplishment, and I’ve mastered it thoroughly.
We Amurricans rinse out with Apollinaris or
ice-water, which isn’t half so comforting, especially in
trouble.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And the Duchess heaved a butterfly’s sigh, which
scarcely stirred her filmy laces, and smoothed her prettiest
eyebrow with one exquisite finger-tip.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Trouble!” exclaimed her friend. “My dear, you’re
the happiest of women. Don’t try to persuade me that
you’ve got a silent sorrow!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not exactly a silent one, because I’m going to confide
in you; but still it is a sorrow.” The Duchess confided
one hand to her dearest friend’s consoling clasp,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>and wiped away a tear with a minute handkerchief that
would not have dried half a dozen. “Perhaps Amurrican
blood is warmer than English; but, anyhow, our
family affections are vurry much more strongly developed
over in the States than yours are here. And I had a letter
from Momma by yesterday’s mail that would have
melted a heart of rock.” She dried a second tear. “If
Momma lives till the end of Creation,” she said, “she
will never, never get over it. And I don’t wonder!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Darling, if it would really do you any good to tell
me——” breathed Lady Sidonia.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I tell all my friends,” said the Duchess with a sigh;
“and they’re invariably of one opinion—that Momma
was cruelly victimized.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She is——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Call her forty, dear. It would be just cruel to say
anything more. People call me lovely and all those
things,” said the Duchess candidly, “and I allow they’re
correct. Well, compared with what Momma was at my
age, I’m real ordinary.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Frozen fact! And you can grasp the idea that when—in
spite of every effort—Momma began to lose her figure
and her looks, she felt it!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Every woman must!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But the more she felt it, the more she seemed to
expand.... Grief runs to fat, I do believe,” said the
Duchess. “Of course, Poppa’s allowance to Momma being
liber’l—even for a Corn King—she had unlimited
funds at her disposal. To begin with, she rented a medical
specialist.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who dieted her?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear, for a woman accustomed to French cookery,
and with the national predilection for cookies and
candy, it must have been——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Torture!”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>“One gluten biscuit and the eye of a mutton cutlet
for dinner. Think of it! Beef-juice and dry toast for
breakfast, ditto for supper. And she used to skip—a
woman of that size, too—for hours! And her trainers
came every morning at five o’clock, and they’d make her
just put on a sweater and take her between them for a
sharp trot round Central Park, just as if she’d been a
gentleman jockey sworn to ride at so many stone for a
Plate. And the number of stone Momma got off——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She <em>got</em> them off?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I guess she got them off,” said the Duchess. “Poppa
talked of having an elegant tombstone set up in Central
Park to commemorate the greater portion of a wife
buried there! then he gave up the notion. And then
Momma made handsome presents to her specialist and
her trainers, and contracted with the cleverest operator
in N’York to make a face.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To make a face?” repeated Lady Sidonia.</p>

<p class='c009'>“To make a face for Momma that matched her youthful
figure,” said the Duchess composedly. “My! the
time that man took in creating a surface to work on!
She slept for a fortnight with her countenance covered
with slices of raw veal.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Horrible!” shuddered the listener.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And the massaging and steaming that went on!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can imagine!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The foundations being properly laid——” continued
the Duchess, lighting another cigarette.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lady Sidonia went into a little uncontrollable shriek
of laughter. “As though ... she had been a house!...
Ha, ha, ha!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear,” returned the Duchess, shaking her beautiful
head, “the terms employed in the contract were precisely
those I have quoted.... The specialist laid the
foundations, and carried the contract out. Momma’s
appearance delighted everyone, except Poppa, who has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>old-fashioned notions, and complained of feeling shy in
the presence of a stranger. Fortunately their Silver
Wedding eventuated just then, and his conscience—Poppa’s
conscience is, for a corn speculator’s, wonderfully
sensitive—ceased to annoy him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And your mother?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Momma wore her new face for six months with the
greatest satisfaction,” said the Duchess. “Of course, she
had to lay up for repairs pretty often, but the specialist
was there to carry them out. Unluckily, he contracted a
severe chill in the N’York winter season and died. His
wife put his tools and enamels and things in his coffin.
She said she knew business would be brisk when he got
up again, and she didn’t wish any other speculator to
chip in before him.” The Duchess sighed. “Then came
Momma’s great trouble.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There was no other operator to—take up the—the
contract?” hinted Lady Sidonia.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There were dozens,” said the Duchess, “and Momma
tried them all. My dear, you may surmise what she
looked like.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A heterogeneous mingling of styles.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was impossible to conjecture,” said the Duchess
confidentially, “to what period the original structure belonged.
By day Momma resorted to a hat and voile.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Even in the house?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Even in the house. By night—well, I guess you’ve
noticed that a human work of art, illuminated by electric
light, isn’t seen under the most favorable conditions.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is a pitiless accuracy!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“An unmerciful candor about its revelations. After
one unusually brilliant reception, Momma retired from
society and took to spiritualism. She persevered until
she had materialized that demised face-specialist, and extracted
some definite raps in the way of advice.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And what did he advise?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>“He suggested, through the medium, that Momma
should apply to the Milwaukee Mentalists.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A Society of Faith Healers?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Occult Operatists,’ they call themselves on the prospectuses.
As for the cult of the Society,” said the
Duchess pensively, “one might call it a mayonnaise of
Freemasonry, Theosophy, Hypnotism, Humbug, and
Hoodoo. But the humbug, like salad oil in the mayonnaise,
was the chief ingredient.” The Duchess stopped
to draw breath.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And into this vortex Mrs. Van Wacken was drawn?”
sighed Lady Sidonia.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sucked down and swallowed,” said the Duchess, who
had been Miss Van Wacken. “They undertook to make
Momma right over again, brand new, by prayer and faith
and—a mentally electrified bath. For which treatment
Momma was to pay ten thousand down.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pounds!” shrieked the horrified Lady Sidonia.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dollars,” corrected the Duchess.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In advance?” cried the listener.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In advance, after a demonstration had been given
which was practically to satisfy Momma that the Milwaukee
Mentalists were square,” said the Duchess. “My
word! when I remember how they bluffed that poor darling—I
should want to laugh, if I didn’t cry.” She
dried another tear.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do go on!” entreated her friend.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The High Priestess of the Community was a woman,”
went on the Duchess, “just as cool and ca’am and cunning
as they make ’em.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I guessed as much,” said Lady Sidonia.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It takes a woman to know and work on another
woman’s weak points,” rejoined the Duchess. “The
High Priestess pretended to be in communication with a
spirit. ‘The Mystikos,’ they called him, and he resided,
when he was at home, in a crystal ball; but bullion was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>the real totem of the tribe. Well—but it’s getting
late——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall not sleep a <em>wink</em> until I have heard the <em>whole
story</em>,” said Lady Sidonia.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And Cull and your husband are comparing notes
about their wives in the smoking-room,” said the
Duchess.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, the Theologa——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The—the—what?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Theologa—that was the professional title of the
High Priestess—whose or’nary name was Mrs. Gideon J.
Swale,” her Grace went on, “talked a great deal to
Momma, and made some passes over her, and got the
poor dear completely under her thumb. Momma wasn’t
the only victim, you must know. There were four other
ladies, all wealthy, and each one, like Momma, the leader
of a fashionable society set——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And—no longer young?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And past their first bloom,” amended the Duchess.
“And each of ’em had agreed to plank down the same
sum in cold dollars.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fifty thousand in all,” said Lady Sidonia with a
sigh. She could have done so much with fifty thousand
dollars, even though American money was such beastly
stuff. “Worth——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Worth riskin’ a term in a N’York State prison for—I
guess so!” said the Duchess. “Well, Momma and the
other ladies signed on to the terms, and went through
a cer’mony of purification—which included learnin’ a
kind of catechism used in admittin’ a new member into
the Occult Operatists’ Community—an’ several hymns.
That was to make them worthy to receive the Revelation
from the Mystikos, I guess. At least, the Theologa——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mrs. Gideon J. Swale?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The same. The Theologa said so. In a week or so—durin’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>which period they lived at the house of the Community—chiefly
on nuts an’ spring-water——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“For which entertainment they paid——” Lady Sidonia
hinted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Delmonico rates!” said the Duchess. “Well, it was
settled that the Demonstration was to come off, with the
Mystikos’ consent.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What sort of——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Demonstration? Cur’us,” said the Duchess, “and
inter<em>est</em>ing. There was a woman—a Mrs. Gower, English
by birth, Amurrican naturalized—who was to be the
Subject. She was a widow—her husband having met his
death in an explosion at an oil-gas producin’ factory.
Stoker to the gas-generator he was, and his wife had
brought him his dinner—fried steak in a tin pail—when
the hull kitboodle blew up. Husband was killed—wife
was saved, though so scarred and disfigured about the
face as to be changed from a pretty woman into a plain
one.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And she—this scarred, disfigured woman—was to be
made pretty again by the Occult Operatists?” hazarded
Lady Sidonia.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Guessed it first time,” nodded the Duchess. “The
cer’mony took place in a temple belonging to the Community,
all painted over red and yellow triangles and
things like T-squares. At the upper end was an altar,
raised on three steps, and on this was the ground glass
ball in which the Mystikos lived when he wasn’t somewhere
else, and an electric light was fixed over it, so
that it just dazzled your eyes to look at. Below the
altar was a seat for the Theologa, and, you bet,
Mrs. Gideon J. Swale came out strong in the costume
line. Momma was reminded of Titiens in <em>Norma</em>,
she said.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I want to hear about the Demonstration,” pleaded
Lady Sidonia plaintively.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>“My! you’re in a hurry,” said the Duchess. “But
it was to be brought off in a bath—if you must know!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A <em>bath</em>?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A bath that was full of water and boiled herbs, and
had been properly incanted over by the Theologa,” explained
the Duchess. “There were incense-burners all
round, and not far off a kind of tent of white linen, all
over red triangles and T’s. And the five candidates for
renovation—I mean Momma and the other ladies—sat
on a form, in bloomers, each with a little purse-bag containing
bills for ten thousand dollars, and her heart full
of hope and joy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Oh!</em> go on,” cried Lady Sidonia.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The temple was circular, something like the Mormon
Tabernacle at Salt Lake City,” said the Duchess, “and
the Occult Operatives—a round hundred of ’em—occupied
the forms, to assist with the prayers and hymn-singin’.
Of course, the proceedings began with a hymn
sung in several different keys. I surmise the effect was
impressive.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lady Sidonia elevated her eyebrows.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Momma said it was wailful, and made her feel as
though live clams were crawling up and down her back.
But then the bloomers may account for that,” said the
Duchess, “and I guess the temple registers were out of
order. Then—the lights were suddenly turned out!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“O-oh!” shivered Lady Sidonia.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Except the electric stars over the Mystikos’ crystal
ball,” went on the Duchess, “so that all the light in the
temple seemed to come from the altar. Momma said that
made her feel those crawling clams worse than ever.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Could one see plainly what was going on?” asked
Lady Sidonia.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was a religious kind of dimness,” said the Duchess,
“but most everything showed plainly. For instance,
when the hideous woman who was to be the Subject of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>the Demonstration came out of the linen tent in a suit
of bloomers like Momma’s and the others, she appeared
to be plain enough. Do you keep a cat, dear?” whispered
the Duchess.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why? No!” said Lady Sidonia.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I thought I heard a scratching at the door,” explained
the Duchess, with her mouth close to Lady Sidonia’s
ear. “Don’t open it.... I’d rather—— Where
was I?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Subject was in bloomers,” said Lady Sidonia.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, well! Momma and the other ladies were asked
to look at her earnestly, to fix her features in their
minds, so that they couldn’t but recognize her again if
they saw her. She was a slight woman, Momma said,
about thirty-five, and but for her scarred face would
have been pretty, with her pale complexion, brown wavy
hair, and large gray eyes with black lashes.... She
had one peculiarity about the left hand, which no one
who ever saw it could forget. What are you listening
for?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>I</em> hear something at the door,” faltered Lady Sidonia
in a nervous undertone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fancy. You don’t keep a cat. Well, the Subject
went up to the altar and knelt, and the Theologa—Mrs.
Gideon J. Swale—invoked the Mystikos in a solemn kind
of conjuration, and the crystal ball on the altar began
to hop up and down.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fact! Then it rose right off the altar and hung suspended
in the air, and the hymn broke out worse than
ever, and the Theologa led the Subject down the altar
steps and put her into the bath.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well?” gasped Lady Sidonia.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Theologa threw incense on the burners round
the bath, and perfect clouds rose up all round it, completely
hiding the Subject,” explained the Duchess.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>“Then she——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She began to scream.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To scream?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“As if she was in absolute agony; and Momma and
the four other ladies nearly fainted off their form, they
were so perfectly terrified.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And—what happened?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There was a scream more piercing than any of the
others.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The clouds of incense became so thick that you
couldn’t see your hand.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Occult Operatives sang more loudly and less in
tune than ever, and the crystal ball kept on jumping up
and down. Then the clouds of smoke cleared away, and
the lights went up, and——” The Duchess paused provokingly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go on, go on!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And the Subject got out of the bath.... And she
had been ugly and scarred when she went in, but now
she was young and pretty!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Impossible!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was the same woman to all appearances, but
changed—wonderfully changed. The same pretty
brown hair, the same eyes, gray, with long curly black
lashes, and the same strange malformation of one finger
of the left hand. But no cicatrices, none of the seams
and marks that made the other frightful.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The other!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did I say the other?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then I guess I let the cat out of the bag.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, I begin to understand!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I thought you’d tumble.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There were two women—exactly alike!”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>“No, goosey! One woman younger than the other, and
looking exactly like her, as <em>she</em> looked before the injury
to her face.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sisters?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No. Mother and daughter.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And the change in the bath?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Managed with a false bottom and trap exit. The
sort of trick one sees exposed at the Egyptian Hall.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And the daughter took the mother’s place?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Under cover of the incense—and the singing. The
tent held <em>two</em>, you understand.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But Mrs. Van Wacken?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Momma and the other ladies—once the thing had
been proved genuine—were only too anxious to plank
down their money and hop into the wonderful bath. So
they went up to the Theologa, and she blessed them and
laid the five money-bags on the altar, and then——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then all the lights went out,” said the Duchess, “and
there was a kind of stampede, and Momma and the four
other ladies found themselves alone in the temple. The
Theologa and the Subject and the hundred members of
the Community who’d sat round on the seats and helped
with the hymns were gone—and the dollar bags had vanished.
The doors of the temple were locked, and Momma
and the four other victims had to stop there until the
morning. An express man heard their cries for help,
broke in the door, and took them to an hotel in his wagon.
Dear, I’m going to toddle to by-by!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was an awful—awful swindle,” said Lady Sidonia,
as she and the Duchess kissed good-night.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And the exposure!” The Duchess shrugged her
shoulders. “Momma and the other ladies wanted it
hushed, but the police went into the matter.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Were the swindlers arrested?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Theologa was caught at Amsterdam, and extradited.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>The Community got off. Nobody could prove any
of them had had any of the money. I guess,” said the
Duchess, yawning, “Mrs. Gideon J. Swale knows where
it is. But she’s in prison, now, dear. And I hope she
likes it. As for the woman and her daughter, whose likenesses
to each other had been made use of by Mrs.
Gideon—they’re still at large. Good-night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do tell me,” pressed Lady Sidonia. “That peculiarity
of one finger of the left hand possessed by both
mother and daughter—what was it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was,” said the Duchess, “a double nail.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>How</em> odd!” said Lady Sidonia. “My maid has the
same queer deformity, and it is the only thing I don’t
like about her.... She hates to have it noticed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I guess she does,” said the Duchess.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look at her hand to-morrow,” said Lady Sidonia.
“It’s awfully queer. Don’t forget.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I won’t,” said the Duchess. “But she won’t be here
to-morrow!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lady Sidonia’s eyes opened to their widest extent.
“Won’t—<em>be here</em>?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No. She is the girl who got out of the bath!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good heavens!” cried Lady Sidonia. “How do you——Are
you——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I had been shown her photograph by the police—recognized
her the moment I saw her,” said the Duchess.
“I’m not mistaken any, you may be sure. But you
needn’t trouble about her. She’s gone!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gone!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She was listening at the door, and heard the whole
story. When <em>you</em> spoke about the cat, she made tracks.
She’s clear of this house by now, you may bet your back
teeth. Don’t worry about her,” said the Duchess. “I’ll
send my own maid to you in the morning. Good-night!”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>THE BREAKING PLACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'><em>Being a letter from Miss Tossie Trilbina, of No. 000,
Giddingham Mansions, W., to the Editor of “The
Keyhole,” an illustrated Weekly Journal of Caterings
for the Curious.</em></p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p class='c009'>Since reserve and reticence can be carried too far by
a lady, I drop the present line of explanation, the newspapers
having took so kind a interest in the differences
between me and Lord Wretchingham. And if poets ask
what’s in a name, the experience of me and many another
young lady whose talent for the Stage, developed by application
and go-aheadness, not to say good luck—for
that there is such a thing must be plain to the stubbornest
person—has made her friends from the Orchestra—(you’d
never guess how the Second Violin can
queer you in an accomp. if you hadn’t experienced it!)—to
the highest row in the Threepenny Gallery at The
Druids, or the shilling one at The Troc.—would answer,
<em>more than people think for</em>!</p>

<p class='c009'>My poor dear mother, who has been pretty nearly
crazy about the affair, in that shrinking from publicity
which is natural to a lady, told the young gentleman
from <cite>The Keyhole</cite>, who dropped in on her at her little
place at Brixton, to fish and find out for himself why
the marriage-engagement between her daughter and his
lordship should have been broken off on the very verge
of the altar.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of course, I don’t assume his lordship’s proposal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>wasn’t a compliment to a young lady in the Profession;
but lordly roofs and music halls may cover vice or shelter
virtue, as one of the serio characters so beautifully said
in the autumn show at dear old Drury Lane, the name
of which has slipped me. And I don’t pretend that
my deepest and holiest feelings were not wrenched a bit
by me having to say in two words, after mutual vows
and presents of the solemnest kind had been exchanged
between me and Lord Wretchingham: “All is over
between you and me for ever, Hildebrand; and if you
possess the mind as well as the manners and appearance
of a gentleman, you will not force me to give you the
definite chuck.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He went on awfully, grinding the heels of his boots
into a brand-new Wilton carpet, and telling me over and
over that I had no heart and never loved him, concerning
which I prefer to keep myself to myself. There
are those that make as much noise when things go wrong
with ’em as a one-and-fourpenny sparking-plug, and
there are others that keep theirselves to theirselves and
suffer in silence, of which I hope I am one. Even supposing
my ancestry did not toddle over with Edward the
Conkeror, which they may, for all I know.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was on the very first night of the production of <cite>The
Pop-in-Taw Girl</cite>, by the Trust or Bust Theatrical Syndicate,
at the Hiram P. Goff Theatre, W., that Lord
Wretchingham caught my eye. Musical Comedy is my
strongest weakness, for though a principal boy’s part,
with heaps of changes, and electro-calcium with chromatic
glasses for every song and dance touches the
spot, pantomime is not so refined. Perhaps you may recall
the record hits I made in “Freddy’s Flannel Waistcoat
Wilted in the Wash,” and “Lay Your Head on My
Shoulder, Dear.” Not that it’s my habit to refer to my
successes, but the street organs alone will rub it in when
you happen to be the idol of the hour.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>He sat with his mouth wide open—of course, I refer to
Lord Wretchingham—all the time yours truly was on
the stage, and I will say no gentleman could have a more
delicate regard for a young lady’s feelings than his
lordship did in sending a perfect haystack of the most
expensive hothouse flowers addressed to Miss Tossie Trilbina,
with a diamond and turquoise muff-chain twined
round the moss handle of the basket, and not a speck of
address on the card for my poor dear mother to return
the jewelry to, her being over and above particular, I
have often thought, in discouraging attentions that only
sprang from gentlemen’s appreciation of the performance,
and masked nothing the smallest objections could
be taken to.</p>

<p class='c009'>She quite warmed to Lord Wretchingham, I will say,
when him being respectfully presented by the Syndicate,
and me being recommended fresh country air by the
doctors when suffering from tonsils in the throat, his
lordship placed his motor-car at my disposal. With
poor dear mother invariably in the glass compartment
behind, the tongue of scandal could not possibly find
a handle, and her astonishment when she discovered
that Hildebrand regarded me with a warmer feeling
than that of mere admiration gave her quite a turn.</p>

<p class='c009'>We were formally engaged—me and Lord Wretchingham.
We kept the thing so dark I cannot think how
the newspapers managed to get hold of it. But a public
favorite must pay the price of popularity in having her
private affairs discussed by the crowd. My poor dear
mother felt it, but there! what can you do? With interviewers
calling same time as the milk, and Press
snap-shotters lurking behind the laurel bushes in the
front garden, is it to be wondered at that Hildebrand’s
family were apprised of our betrothal not only by pars.,
but by the publication of our photographs, taken hand-in-hand
on my poor dear mother’s doorstep, with a vine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>climbing up behind us, Hildebrand’s motor car, an 18.26
h. p. “Gadabout,” at the bottom of the doorsteps, with
the French <em>chofore parley-vousing</em> away a good one to
the three Japanese pugs, and poor dear mother, looking
a perfect lady, at her fancy-work, in the front parlor
window. How the negative was obtained, and how it
found its way into all the Illustrated Papers, and particularly
how it got upon the postcards, I don’t pretend
to guess. It’s one of those regular mysteries you come
across in real life.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hildebrand, or, possibly, as all is over, I should say
Lord Wretchingham’s family, went into perfect fits when
the news of our betrothal leaked out. The Earl of
Blandish, his father, raged like a mad bull; and the
Countess, his mother, implored him on her knees to break
the engagement.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh,” she said, with the tears in her eyes, “my own
boy,” she said, “do not, I beg of you,” she said—for,
of course, I got it all out of Hildebrand afterwards—“show
yourself to be of so weak and unoriginal a cast
of mind as to follow the example of the countless other
young men of rank and property,” she said, “who have
contracted unequal and unhappy unions with young women
on the boards,” she said—and like her classy cheek!
Upon which Lord Wretchingham calmly up and told
her that his word was his bond, and that I had got both;
my poor dear mother having insisted from the beginning
that things should be set down in black and white,
which the spelling of irrevokable almost proved a barrier
the poor dear could not tackle, his education having
been neglected at Eton to that extent.</p>

<p class='c009'>Me and my poor dear mother being—I don’t mind
telling you on the strict—prepared for a struggle with
Wretchingham’s family, was more than surprised when,
after a Saturday to Monday of anxious expectancy, a
note on plain paper with a coronet stamped in white
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>from Lady Blandish informed us that her ladyship had
made up her mind to call. And she kept the appointment
as punctual as clockwork, driving up in a taxi, and
perfectly plainly dressed; and when I made my entrance
in the dearest morning arrangement of Valenciennes
lace and baby ribbon you ever saw, I will say
she met me like a lady should her son’s intended, and
said that Lord Blandish and her had come to the determination
to make the best of their son’s choice, and
invited me down to stay at Blandish Towers, in Huntshire,
when the run of <cite>The Pop-in-Taw Girl</cite> broke off for
the autumn holidays.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh,” I said, “Lady Blandish,” I said, “of course, I
shall be perfectly delighted,” and let her know how
unwilling I felt as a lady to make bad blood between
Lord Wretchingham and his family. “But, of course,”
I said, “my duty to the man who I have vowed to
love and honor leaves me no choice.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear Miss Tossie Trilbina,” she said, “your sentiments
towards Wretchingham do you the utmost
credit,” she said, and I explained to her that though
the surname sounds foreign, there is nothing of the
Italiano-ice-creamo about yours truly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” she said, in that sweetly nasty way that the
Upper Ten do seem to have the knack of, “do not
trouble to explain, my dear Miss Trilbina. Lord Blandish
and myself are quite prepared,” she said, “to
accept the inevitable,” she said, and kissed me, and
smiled a great deal at my poor dear mother, who was
explaining to her ladyship that her family did not regard
an alliance with the aristocracy as anything but
a match between equals, and that my education had
been of the most expensive and classy kind you can
imagine. And smiled herself into her taxi, and motored
away.</p>

<p class='c009'>That was in the middle of the summer season, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>I bespoke my costumes for my visit to my new relations
next day. Of course, I expected a house-party of really
hall-marky, classy swells, and meant to do the honors
and help Lady Blandish to entertain as was my duty
bound. And my shooting and golfing and angling costumes,
and motoring get-up and riding-habit, and tea-gowns
and dinner-dresses and ball-confections, were
a fair old treat to see, and did Madame Battens credit.</p>

<p class='c009'>Wretchingham drove me down in his 18.26 h.p. “Gadabout,”
with my dresser-maid in the glass case behind,
and an omnibus motor from the garage behind us with
my dressing-baskets, and I thought of poor dear mother
at home, I don’t mind telling you, when the Towers
rose up at the end of an oak avenue longer than Regent
Street, and Wretchingham’s two sisters came running
down the steps to hug their brother and be presented
to their new sister, and the white-headed family butler
threw a glass door open and Wretchingham led me in
between six footmen, bowing, three on each side.</p>

<p class='c009'>What price poor little me when I heard there wasn’t
any House-Party? Cheap wasn’t the word, with all
those costumes in my dress-baskets. However, I faked
myself up in a frock that I really felt was a credit to
a person of my rank and station, and swam down to
what her ladyship called a “quiet family dinner.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Earl of Blandish came in, leaning on his secretary’s
arm, with a gouty foot, and did the heavy father,
calling me “my dear.” I sat on his lordship’s right
hand, and certainly he was most agreeable, telling me
the black oak carvings in the great hall were by Jacob
Bean, and that the walled garden with a separate division
for every month in the year and a bowling alley in the
middle had been made by a lady ancestor of his who
lived in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and was a friend
of the person who wrote Shakespeare.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” I said, “I suppose,” I said, “in those days
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>bowls were not considered a low form of amusement.
Though if ever my poor dear mother and father did
have to call words, it would be over his weakness for
bowls and skittles as a waste of time and leading to
betting and drink. And as for Shakespeare, I call it
all very well for literary swells with nothing else to do,”
I said, “but what the Halls cater for is the business
gentleman who drops in with a pal to hear the popular
favorite in a ten-o’clock turn over a cigar and a small
Scotch. And gardening never was much in my line,” I
said, “though when a child it was my favorite amusement
to grow mustard and cress on damp flannel. Hunting
is my passion,” I said, “and as Wretchingham has
told me you keep a first-class stable of hunters and
hacks, besides carriage beasts, I hope to show your lordship
that I shan’t disgrace you,” I said, and asked him
when the next meet would be?</p>

<p class='c009'>The Earl’s old eyebrows went up to the top of his
aristocratic bald forehead as he said not until October,
and then only for cubbing, and the two girls flushed
up red, trying not to laugh, and wriggled in their chairs,
and Lady Blandish said in her nice nasty way that
every day brought innovations, and one might as well
ride to hounds in August as skate on artificial ice in
May.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And if you are fond of sport,” Lord Blandish said,
“we could possibly find you some fishing. Don’t you
think so, my dear?” and he looked at his wife.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have my salmoning costume with me,” I said, just
to let them know, “and a rod, and everything. And I
suppose Wretchie won’t object,” I said, giving the poor
thing a smile, “to prompt me if I am fluffy in the business.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dear me!” said Lady Blandish, “how stupid of me
not to have explained before,” she said, “that this is a
trouting County and not a salmon County, and that such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>trout as there are run very small.” And the two girls
choked again in the most underbred way I ever.</p>

<p class='c009'>I said I’d fall back on golf, having a killing get-up in
my basket, but there wasn’t a links within miles, Lady
Blandish said, and how sorry she was. All the hot-weather
entertainment she had it in her power to offer
me in their quiet country home, she said, was an occasional
flower-show, or County cricket-match, or a garden-party,
or a friendly dinner with people who were not
<em>too</em> exacting. In September there would be the birds,
but then I would not be there. It was too unfortunate,
she said. Not that her saying so took me in much.</p>

<p class='c009'>I thought the top of my head would have come off
with yawning that evening, I really did; and when I remembered
that there were three weeks more of it before
me I could have screamed out loud. Me and Wretchingham
went for a spin in his T-cart next morning before
lunch, and that drive settled me in deciding to off it on
the next chance.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tossie darling,” said the poor dear thing, “it has
gratified my father exceedingly to ascertain,” he said,
“that you are fond of the country; because a condition
of the provision he is willing to make for us when
we are married,” he said—and he would have put his
arm round my waist only the trotter shied—“is that
we reside at the Dower House,” he said, “twenty miles
from here, and lead a healthy life in accordance with
his views as regards what is appropriate for future land-owners
who will one day hold a solid stake in the County.
Of course, you will leave the Stage forever, my darling,”
he said, “as a future Countess of Blandish cannot
figure upon the Lyric Boards,” he said, “without in
some degree compromising her reputation and bringing
discredit upon the family of which,” he said, “she has
become a member. My father will allow us two thousand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>a year at first,” he said, “which will enable us
to keep a couple of motor-cars and a hack or two, and
with an occasional week-end in Town, I have no doubt,”
he said, “that our married life will be,” he said, “one
of ideal happiness for both of us. You observe,” he
said, pointing with his whip straight over the trotter’s
ears, “that rather low-pitched stone building of the
Grange description down in that wooded hollow there?
The house is quite commodious,” he said. “You will
appreciate the exceptional garden; and as there is a
good deal of arable land comprised,” he said, “in the
estate, I shall take up farming,” he said, “with enthusiasm.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You may take up farming,” I said haughtily, “with
enthusiasm, dear old boy; but what I say is, you will not
take it up with yours truly! Do you suppose in cold
blood that Tossie Trilbina is the sort of girl to sit down
in the middle of a ploughed field and lead a life of ideal
happiness with a farming husband in gaiters,” I said,
tossing my head, “telling me how the turnips are looking
every evening at dinner, and taking me up to Town
for a week-end,” I said, “every now and then as a treat?
No, Hildebrand,” I said, “clearly understand, much as
I regret to say it, that I am not taking any; and unless
the old gentleman can be brought to see the reason,”
I said, “of a flat in Mayfair, all is over betwixt me
and you, and I shall go back to my poor dear mother
by to-night’s express,” I said, “if the lacerated state of
your feelings does not permit,” I said, “of your taking
the steering-wheel.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Of course, the poor dear thing was dreadfully upset,
and did his little best to bring Lord Blandish to weaken
on his spiteful old determination; and Lady Blandish
said heaps of nice-sounding nasty things, and the two
girls tried to be sympathetic and not to look as if they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>were really ready to jump for joy. But the Earl remained
relentless, and Lord Wretchingham is free. I
must now close. Hoping you will accept this explanation
in the spirit in which it is made,</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>

  <h2 class='c005'>A LANCASHIRE DAISY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>One of the giant police-constables on duty outside
the Cotton Hall, Smutchester, upon the occasion of the
Conference of the National Union for the Emancipation
of Women Workers, was seized with the spirit of prophecy
when he saw Sal o’ Peg’s borne in, gesticulating,
declaiming, carried head and shoulders above an insurging
wave of beshawled and rampant factory-girls.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Theeaw goes th’ Stormy Pettrill, Tum!” he roared
to a fellow guardian of the public peace. “Neeaw us
be sewer to ha’ trooble wi’ theeay——” He did not add
“tykes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thee mun be misteeawken, mon,” urged Tum, who
had newly joined the Smutchester City Division. “’Tis
boh a lil’ feer-feaced gell aw cud braak between ma
finger an’ thoomb lig a staalk o’ celery.” The great blue
eyes of the “lil’ feer-feaced gell” had done execution,
it was plain, and the first speaker, who was a married
man, snorted contemptuously. Sal o’ Peg’s had completely
earned the disturbing nickname bestowed on her.
The courts and alleys of the roaring black city would
vomit angry, white-gilled, heavy-shod men and women at
one shrill, summoning screech of hers. The police-constable
upon whose features she had more recently executed
a clog war-dance was not yet discharged from the
Infirmary, though the seventeen years and fragile proportions
of his assailant had, for the twentieth time, softened
“th’ Beawk” into letting Sal o’ Peg’s off with the
option of a fortnight or a fine, and the threat of being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>bound over to keep the peace next time, if she insisted
in being “so naughty.”</p>

<p class='c009'>With these blushing honors thick upon her, Sal o’
Peg’s attended the Conference, and became, before the
close of the presidential address, an ardent convert to the
cause of Female Suffrage. During the debate she
climbed a pillar and addressed the meeting, and when,
with immense difficulty, dislodged from her post of vantage,
she took the platform by storm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, it’s a child!” chorused the delegates from the
different branches of the Union, whose ramifications extend
over the civilized globe, as the small, slim, light-haired
young person in the inevitable shawl, print gown,
and clogs climbed over the brass platform-rail, and, folding
cotton-blouse-clad arms upon a flat, girlish bosom,
stood motionless, composed, even cheerful, in the full
glare of the electric chandelier, and under the full play
of a battery of some two thousand feminine eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do let the little darling speak,” begged the Honorary
Secretary of the Chairwoman, who, as a native of
Smutchester, had her doubts. But Sal o’ Peg’s had not
the faintest intention of waiting for permission.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah’m not bit o’ good at long words, gells,” said Sal
o’ Peg’s. “Mappen ah’ll be better ondersteawd wi’oot
’em.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The thunder of clogs in the body of the hall said
“Yes!” She went on: “Wimmin sheawd ha’ th’ Vote.
’Tis theear roight.” (Tremendous clogging, mingled
with shrieks of “Weel seayd, lass! Gie us th’ Vote!”)
She hitched her shawl about her with the factory-girl’s
movement of the shoulders, and went on. “Yo’ll noan
fleg me wi’ yo’re din. Ah’m boh a lil’ un, boh af ha’
got spunk. If you doubt thot——” A hundred strident
voices from the body of the hall sent back the refrain,
“Ask a pleeceman!” A roar of laughter shook the
roof.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>“Ought we to interfere?” whispered the Honorary
Secretary.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear, why should we?” said a London delegate,
leaning forward to answer. “The girl has got them in
the hollow of her hand. A born leader of women—a
born leader. She voices in her untaught speech the
heart-cry of thousands of her dumb and helpless sisters.
She——”</p>

<p class='c009'>The born leader of women continued:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah dunno whoy ah niver thout o’ it before, but ’tis
a beawrfeaced robbery neawt to gie us th’ Vote. Oor
feythers has it, an’ sells it fur braass.” (Screams,
shrieks, and clogging.) “Oor heawsbands has it, an’ sells
it fur braass.” (Tempestuous applause.) “Oor lads,
theay has it, an’ sells it fur braass. Whoy shouldna’ we
ha’ it, an’ sell it for braass tew?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The enthusiasm with which this brilliant peroration
was received nearly wrecked the Cotton Hall. No more
speeches were heard that night, though several were delivered
in dumb show, and Sal o’ Peg’s awakened upon
the morrow to find her utterances reported in the newspapers.
To the sarcasm of the leader-writer Sal o’ Peg’s
was impervious. She “mun goo t’ Lunnon neixt,” she
said, “an’ leawt them tykes at the Hoose o’ Commeawns
knaw a bit” of her mind. She wasn’t afraid of Prime
Ministers—not she. She called at the branch office of
the Union twice a day, imperatively requesting to be
forwarded as a delegate to the Metropolis. When her
services were declined with thanks, she harangued the
populace from the doorstep. When politely requested
to move on, she broke a window with one clog, and patted
the office-boy violently upon the head with the other.
Then she burst into tears and retired, supported by a
dozen or so of sympathizing comrades of the factory.</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Tis a beeawrnin’ sheame!” they said, as they fastened
up their chosen representative’s loosened flaxen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>coils with hairpins of the patent explosive kind, contributed
from their own solid braids. “But donnot thee
fret, Sal o’ Peg’s, us’ll ha’ nah dollygeat but thee, sitha
lass!” And they sent the hat round among themselves
with right goodwill. They were not quite sure what a
“dollygeat” was, but thought it was something that
could walk into the House of Commons, defy a Minister
to his nose, dance a clog-dance in the gangway
of the Upper House, and receive in chests and bagsful
all the good money that women had been defrauded of
since the masculine voter first plumped for a consideration;
of that they were “as sure as deeawth.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So Sal o’ Peg’s gave notice at the factory that, being
thenceforth called to figure upon the arena of political
life, she could not tend frames any longer. She bought
a black sailor straw hat with a portion of the subscribed
fund, and tied up the most cherished articles of her
wardrobe in a blue-spotted handkerchief bundle. She
traveled express to London, choosing a “smoking third,”
as affording atmospherical and social conditions less remote
from her lifelong experience.... The journey
was purely uneventful: a young man of unrestrained
amorous proclivities receiving a black eye, and a young
woman who sneered too openly at the blue-spotted handkerchief
bundle suffering the wreck of a bandbox and
sustaining a few scratches. The guard—alas! for the
frailty of man—being all upon the side of the blue eyes
and flaxen coils of hair....</p>

<p class='c009'>I suppose the reader knows Pelham’s Inn, W. C.,
where are the headquarters of the National Union for
the Emancipation of Working Women? There is no
padding to the armchairs, cocoanut matting of a severe
and rasping character covers the Committee-room
boards; the Committee inkstand is of the zinc office
description (the Committee are not there to be comfortable—just
the reverse). They are busy women of small
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>spare time and narrow spare means; but when they
found Sal o’ Peg’s sitting on the doorstep, they found
leisure to be kind. They looked at the clogs with pity,
unaware of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pas seul</span></i> they had performed upon the
countenance of a policeman still in bandages, and the
great blue eyes yearning out of the small pale face, and
the ropes of fair hair tumbling over the shabby shawl
that enfolded the childish figure of the little factory-girl
who had traveled up to London for the sake of the
Cause, won them to practical expression of the sympathy
they felt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So different a type to the brawling, violent creature,”
they said, “who nearly caused a riot at the Smutchester
Conference. Her one dream is to see the House
of Commons and speak a word in public for her toiling
sisters of the factories.” And those of them who wore
glasses found them dimmed with the dews of sympathetic
emotion. It was such a touching story, they said, of faith
and enthusiasm and courage.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is upon the Records of the Nation that the events I
have to relate took place in the Central Hall of the sacred
fane of Westminster between four and five o’clock in the
afternoon, when twenty or thirty ladies, well-known adherents
of the Cause, appeared upon the scene and asked
for Suffrage. It was an act of presumption, almost of
treason, bordering on blasphemy. Still, the arguments
that were not drowned were sound. They were all householders,
taxpayers, earners, and owners of independent
incomes one daring female said, and as the drunken husband
of her charwoman possessed a vote, she thought she
had a right to have one also. The Sergeant-at-Arms instantly
directed a constable to quell her. Another audacious
creature asked for the Vote Qualified. She demanded
that the Suffrage should indeed be given to
women, but only to those women who should, by passing
a viva voce examination on the duties of citizenship,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>prove themselves fit to discharge them.... She was
listened to with some attention until she suggested that
male voters should be subjected to a similar weeding-out
process; upon which a portly inspector bore down upon
her, clasped her in a blue embrace, and carried her, protesting
loudly, down the hall, amidst demonstrations of
intense excitement. Members cried, “Shame!” Members
cried, “Serve her right!” Passing peers put up
eyeglasses and stayed to see the fun. Hustled women
shrieked, “Cowards!” Pushed women cried, “Let us
alone!” Punched women only said, “Owch!” ... It
was freely translated “Wretch!” for the occasion. The
middle-aged and advanced in years met the same treatment
as the younger and more excitable.... All were
unceremoniously expelled by the stalwart beings in blue
from the sacred precincts where such inviolable order
is habitually maintained, and where all the Proprieties
find their permanent home. Crushed headgear, scattered
handbags, and strange derelict fragments of feminine
attire bestrewed the scene of the one-sided fray;
the crowds of sympathizers outside cried, “Boo!” and
waved white flags in defiance as a dozen arrests were
made in a dozen seconds.... And a young woman in
a brown plaid shawl and brass-bound clogs danced with
shoutings upon the pavements of St. Stephen’s Porch,
and while her long, light coils of hair came down and
her hairpins were scattered to the winds of Westminster,
she asked, in the Lancashire dialect, for admittance
to the Bar of the House; for justice for the oppression
and downtrodden; for the blood of Ministers, Peers, and
Members; and for the viscera of the officials who were
their tools. She told the Chancellor of the Exchequer
to come out and bring the Treasury with him; and when
he did not come, she knocked off one policeman’s helmet
and smote another with one of her clogs—<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">toujours</span></i> those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>clogs!—upon the nose. Also she relieved a third of half
a whisker, bit another in the hand, kicked them all in
the shins, and generally made history as six police-constables
bore her, shrieking at the full pitch of excellent
lungs, to Blunderbuss Row Police Station.</p>

<p class='c009'>There were newspaper headlines next day—“Bedlam
Let Loose!” “The Shrieking Sisterhood!” “The Termagant
Spirit!” “No Choice but to Use Force!” The arrested
demonstrators were paraded at the police-court;
the damaged policemen made an imposing show. Tears
choked the utterance of Mr. Vincent Squeers, presiding
magistrate, as he asked: “Were thee, indeed, women
who had abraded the features, discolored the eyes,
bruised the shins, and plucked the whiskers from the
gallant constables who stood before him? Nay, but Mænads,
Bacchantes, priestesses of savage rites, unsexed
Amazons—in two words, emancipated females!” He
found a melancholy relief in imposing a fine that had
no precedent in cases of brawling, or fourteen days’ imprisonment.
He should not be surprised to hear that
these hunters after vulgar notoriety preferred to go to
Holloway, to luxuriate on prison fare, enjoy calm, undeserved
repose on straw beds, and clothe their unregenerate
limbs with the drab garments generously provided
by the nation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But there is one among you,” cried Mr. Vincent
Squeers, “who has been innocently led away by your
pernicious example, but whom the spirit of Justice, that
dwells in the bosom of every Englishman, that hovers,
genius-like, above this Bench to-day”—the chief clerk
hastily produced a white handkerchief, and the reporters
shook freedom into the flow of their Geyser pens—“will
stretch forth a hand to protect and to aid. I speak of
this simple, artless child....” A police-constable felt
his nose, and another groped for his missing whisker
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>as Sal o’ Peg’s stood up in the dock. “Lured from her
humble home, from her laborious employment, from her
upright-minded, honest associates, by these immodest and
unwomanly women, cast a stranger upon the streets of
London, this simple country blossom, wilting in the
atmosphere tainted by habitual vice and common crime,
appeals to the chivalry of every honest man who ever
had a mother”—the chief clerk was carried from the
court in hysterics—“ay, to the pity of every woman
who is not bereft of that heavenly attribute.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sheawt opp, thee donowt owd hosebird!” said Sal o’
Peg’s. “Dosta think ah niver weur in a teawzle in th’
streeawts or a skirmidge wi’ th’ police afeore? Dustha
see th’ pickle theam girt big cheawps is in? If theay
saay theay got theawee scratts an’ sogers fra’ eany
wench but Sal o’ Peg’s, they be leears aw! Sitha? An’
as to yon weumen an’ lasses, yo ca’ baad neams, I ha’
nowt o’ truck wi’ they. I coom to Lunnon as a dollygeat
fra myseln. Sitha?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The child speaks only the roughest dialect of her
native Lancashire,” continued Mr. Vincent Squeers,
“which, I own, I am unable to comprehend. How could
the hapless young creature understand the poisonous
shibboleth poured into her ears by the abandoned sisterhood
whose leading evil spirits are now before me? They
have denied all knowledge of or connection with her”—(as
indeed they had)—“her who stands here—oh, shame
and utter disgrace!—in the dock of a police court as a
result of their vile and treacherous usage in dragging
her from her home. She is sufficiently punished by this
outrage upon that innate modesty which is as the bloom
upon the peach, the—er, ah!—dew upon the daisy. Fined
three-and-sixpence, and I will order that the same be
discharged out of the Court poor-box. The Missionary
will now take charge of the poor young creature, who
will, I trust—ah!—be returned to her sorrowing family
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>in the course of the next twenty-four hours. Good-day,
my dear child—good-day!”</p>

<p class='c009'>A clog whizzed from the dock and hit the paneling
behind the Bench. The Magistrate looked another way,
the constables coughed behind their large white gloves
as Sal o’ Peg’s, weeping bitterly, was led away by the
Court Missionary, a bearded person in rusty black, with
a felt pudding-basin hat and a soiled white necktie.
Robbed of the glory of battle, denied her meed of acknowledgment
for doughty deeds achieved, bereft of her
Amazonian reputation, Sal o’ Peg’s felt that life was
“scarcelin’s weath livin’.” And the afternoon newspapers
administered the final blow. Every leader-writer
shed tears of pure ink over the child lured from home,
the “daisy with the dew upon it” sprouted in a dozen
paragraphs. Only in Smutchester there was Homeric
jest and uproarious laughter. The girls of the cotton-mills,
the policemen of the Lower Town—these knew
their Sal o’ Peg’s, and were loud in their appreciation
of the satiric humor of the London newspapers. The
Missionary did not see his precious charge into the train
for Smutchester; a clergyman’s daughter, who had come
into accidentally compromising relations with an American
gentleman’s diamond evening solitaire and “wad”
of bank-notes, urgently required his ministrations. So
a burly police-constable, with one whisker and a sore
place on the denuded cheek, performed the charitable
office. In the four-wheeler, turning into the Euston
Road, Sal o’ Peg’s said suddenly:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thoo wastna’ sheaved this mearnin’, lad?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I ’adn’t no time, for one thing,” said the police-constable
sulkily; “an’ for another, I ’ad to keep this
whisker on as evidence that you’d pulled out the other.
And a lot o’ good evidence does when Old Foxey”—this
was the nickname bestowed upon Mr. Vincent
Squeers by the staff of the Court—“’as made up ‘is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>mind not to listen to it.” He rubbed the remaining
whisker thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Eh, laad, laad!” cried Sal o’ Peg’s, bursting into
tears and falling upon the neck of the astonished police-constable,
“but theaw knows ah did it. Theaw said sa
just neaw. Eh, laad, laad!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you a-crying?” asked the police-constable, over
whose blue tunic meandered the heavy twists of fair hair
which invariably tumbled down under stress of Sal o’
Peg’s emotion. “Are you a-crying because you’re sorry
you pulled out my whisker, or glad as that you did it?
Which?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Sal o’ Peg’s lifted radiant, tearful blue eyes to the
burly police-constable’s, which were little and piggish,
but twinkling with something more than mere reproof.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah be gleawd,” said Sal o’ Peg’s simply.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well,” said the police-constable, who was not
only a man after all, but a bachelor. He put a large
blue arm round the slim little figure of the war-goddess.
“You’ve ’ad my whisker; <em>I’ll</em> ’ave a kiss.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Teawk it, laad,” said Sal o’ Peg’s.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hitherto, in her short but vivid experience of life,
policemen had occupied a different plane, moved in another
sphere. They were beings to dodge, defy, jeer at,
and punch when you could get them down. Flowerpots
were kept on window-sills of upper floors expressly
for dropping on their helmets. She had danced upon
the upturned face of one, given another a swollen nose,
distributed bites and shin-kicks impartially among others.
This Lunnon one had kissed her for pulling out his
whisker. She looked at him with melting eyes. The
hitherto impregnable bastion of her heart was taken—and
by a member of the Force.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When tha dost sheave, laad, send tha whisker to Ah
by peawst. Th’ address be Sal o’ Peg’s, Briven’s
Buildin’s, Clog Ceawrt, East Side, Smutchester!”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>“I won’t <em>send</em> it, you pretty little bit o’ frock,” said
the enamored police-constable. “I’ll wait till my next
leave an’——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Breng it <em>then</em>, laad,” sighed Sal o’ Peg’s.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>A PITCHED BATTLE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The great Maestro sat at the piano, a small, square
instrument. Upon it were piles of music, a bottle of
Rhine wine, half emptied, a cup of black coffee, a plate
of sliced garlic sausage, and a roll of black bread, peppered
outside with aniseed. A bottle of ink was balanced
on the music-desk, a blotted scroll of paper obscured
the yellowed keyboard. As the great composer
worked at the score of his new opera, he breakfasted,
taking draughts from the bottle, bites of sausage and
bread, and sips of coffee at discretion. He was a quaint,
ungainly figure, with vivacious eyes, and his ill-fitting
auburn wig had served him, like the right lapel of his
plaid dressing-gown, for a pen-wiper for uncounted
years.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Maestro was not alone in the dusty studio to
which so many people, both of the great and little
worlds, sought entrance in vain. An olive-skinned youth,
shabbily dressed in a gray paletot over a worn suit of
black—a young fellow of sixteen, with a square, shaggy
black head and a determined chin, the cleft in which
was rapidly being hidden by an arriving beard—leaned
against a music-stand crammed with portly volumes,
his dark eyes anxiously fixed upon the old gentleman
at the piano, who dipped in the ink and wrote, and
wrote, and dipped in the ink, occasionally laying down
the pen to strike a chord or two, in seeming forgetfulness
of his visitor.</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly the Maestro’s face beamed with a cheerful
smile.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>“There, mon cher Gladiali!” He handed the newly-written
sheet of music to the boy, and spread his wrinkled
fingers above the keys. “This is the great aria-solo
I spoke of. Sing that at sight—your training should
make such a task an easy one—and let us see what stuff
you are made of. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Allons!</span></i>” And he struck the opening
chord.</p>

<p class='c009'>Carlo Gladiali turned pale and then red. He crossed
himself hastily, grasped the sheet of paper, cast his eyes
over it anxiously, and, meeting with a smiling glance
the glittering old eyes of the Maestro, he inflated his
deep chest and sang. A wonderful tenor voice poured
from his boyish throat; heart and soul shone in his eyes
and thrilled in his accents. Tears of delight dropped
upon the piano-keys and upon the hands of the composer,
and when the last pure note soared on high and swelled
and sank, and the song ceased, the old musician cried:
“Thou art a treasure! Come, let me embrace thee!”
and clasped the young singer to his breast. “Once
more, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon fils</span></i>—once more!”</p>

<p class='c009'>And as he seated himself at the piano, sweeping the
plate of sausage into the wastepaper-basket with a flourish
of the large, snuff-stained yellow silk handkerchief
with which he wiped his eyes, the door, which had been
left ajar, was flung open, and a little dark-eyed, fair-haired
girl, who carried a Pierrot-doll, ran quickly into
the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Marraine brought me; she is panting up the stairs
because she is so fat and they are so steep. Oldest
Papa——” she began; but the Maestro held up his hand
for silence as the song recommenced. More assurance
was in Carlo’s phrasing; the flexibility and brilliancy
of his voice were no longer marred by nervousness. As
the solo reached its triumphant close, the Maestro said,
slapping the boy on the back and taking a gigantic
pinch of snuff:</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>“The Archangel Gabriel might have done better.
Aha!” He turned, chuckling, to the little girl, who
stood on one leg in the middle of the narrow room,
pouting and dangling her Pierrot. “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La petite</span></i> there is
jealous. Is it not so?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oldest Papa, you make a very big mistake!” returned
the little maiden, pouting still more. “I am not
jealous of anybody in the world—least of all, a boy
like that!” Her dark eyes rested contemptuously on
the big, shy, square-headed fellow in the gray paletot.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A boy, she calls him!” chuckled the Maestro. “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ma
mignonne</span></i>, he is sixteen—six years older than thyself!
Hasten to grow up, become a great <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">prima donna</span></i>, and
he shall sing Romeo to thy Juliette—I predict it!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I had rather sing with my cat!” observed the little
lady rudely.</p>

<p class='c009'>Carlo flushed crimson; the Maestro chuckled; and a
stout lady who had followed her, panting, into the room,
murmured, “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Oh! la méchante!</span></i>” adding, as the Maestro
rose to greet her: “But she grows more incorrigible
every day. This morning she pulled the feathers out of
Coco’s tail because he whistled out of tune.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The elfin face of the small sinner dimpled into mischievous
smiles.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But that was not being as wicked as the Maestro,
who got angry at rehearsal, and hit the flute-player on
the head with his <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bâton</span></i>, so that it raised a hump. You
told me that yourself, and how the Maestro——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Quite true, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petite</span></i>; I did fetch him a rap, I promise
you, and afterwards I put bank-notes for a hundred
francs on the lump for a plaster. But come, now, sing
to me, and we will give Signor Carlo here something
worth hearing. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Écoutez, mon cher!</span></i>”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well, I will sing; but, first, Pierrot must be
comfortably seated. That little armchair is just what
he likes!” And, as quick as thought, the willful little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>lady tilted a pile of music out of the little armchair
upon the floor. Then she placed Pierrot very carefully
in his throne, and, bidding him be very good and listen,
because his <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonne petite Maman</span></i> was going to sing him
something pretty, she tripped to the piano, and demurely
requested the aged musician to accompany her
in the Rondo of “Sonnambula.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ah! what a miraculous voice proceeded from that
small, willful throat! Stirred to the depths by the extraordinary
power and beauty of the child’s delivery,
Carlo Gladiali listened enthralled; and when the last
notes rippled from the pretty red lips of the now demure
little creature, the big boy, forgetting her rudeness
and his own shyness, started forward, and, sinking on
one knee and seizing the small hand of the child-singer,
he kissed it impulsively, crying: “Ah, Signorina, you
were right, a thousand times! Compared with you, I
sing like a cat!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no! I did not mean to say that!” the tiny lady
was beginning graciously, when the Maestro broke in:</p>

<p class='c009'>“You both sing like cherubs and say civil things to
one another. One day you will sing like angels—and
quarrel like devils! Please Heaven, you will both make
your <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">début</span></i> under my <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bâton</span></i>, and then, if I crack a flute-player’s
head, it will be for joy.”</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c009'>Ten years had elapsed. Carlo Gladiali had risen to
pre-eminence as a public singer, had attained the prime
of his powers and the apogee of his fame. Courted,
fêted, and adored, the celebrated tenor, sated with success,
laden with gifts, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">blasé</span></i> with admiration, retained
a few characteristics that might remind those who had
known and loved him in boyhood of the ingenuous,
honest, simple Carlo of ten years ago.</p>

<p class='c009'>Certainly Carlo’s jealousy of the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">prima donna</span></i> who
should dare to usurp a greater share of the public plaudits
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>than he himself received was childish in its unreasonableness,
and Othello-like in its tragic intensity.</p>

<p class='c009'>At first, he would join in the compliments, and smile
patronizingly as he helped the successful <em>débutante</em> to
gather up the bouquets. Then his admiration would
cool; he would tolerate, endure, then sneer, and finally
grind his teeth. He would convey to the audience over
one shoulder that they were idiots to applaud, and wither
the triumphant <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cantatrice</span></i> with a look of infinite contempt
over the other. He had been known to feign
sleep in the middle of a great soprano aria which, against
his wish, had been encored. He had—or it was malevolently
reputed so—bribed the hotel waiter to place a
huge dish of macaroni, dressed exquisitely and smoking
hot, in the way of a voracious contralto who within two
hours was to essay for the first time the arduous rôle
of Brynhild. The macaroni had vanished, the contralto
had failed to appear. Numerous were the instances similar
to these recorded of the tenor Gladiali, and repeated
in every corner of the opera-loving world.</p>

<p class='c009'>But it was in London, where the great singer was
“starring” during the Covent Garden Season of 19—,
that the haughty and intolerant Carlo was to meet his
match.</p>

<p class='c009'>At rehearsal one morning, Rebelli, the famous basso,
said to Gladiali, with a twinkle: “A new ‘star’ has
dawned on the operatic horizon. La Betisi, the pretty
little soprano with the fiend’s temper and the seraph’s
voice, has created a furore at Rome and Milan. She will
‘star’ over here in her successful rôles. I have it from
the impresario himself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ebbene!</span></i>” Carlo shrugged his shoulders and smiled
with superb patronage. “We shall be very glad to welcome
the little one.... Artists should know how to
value genius in others.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How well you always express things!” said Rebelli,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>grinning. “She is to sing Isolina in ‘Belverde’ on the
10th. The Spanish <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">prima donna</span></i> has broken her contract.
As Galantuomo, you will have an excellent opportunity
of judging of her talents,” he added, as he
turned away, “and scowling at the lady.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But Carlo did not scowl at first. He was all engaging
courtesy and cordial welcome at the first rehearsal, when
he was presented ceremoniously to a tiny little lady
with willful dark eyes, pouting scarlet lips, and hair as
golden as her own Neapolitan sunshine. She vaguely
reminded the tenor of somebody he had seen before.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Maestro is coming from Naples to conduct,”
he heard Rebelli say. “He vowed that La Betisi should
make her <em>début</em> under no <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bâton</span></i> save his own. Her rôle
will be Isolina in his ‘Belverde,’ in which, you know, she
created such a sensation at La Scala.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you, Signor, are to sing the great part of Galantuomo
in the ‘Belverde’?” said the Betisi demurely to
Gladiali. “This time I will not say, ‘<em>I had rather sing
with my cat!</em>’”</p>

<p class='c009'>Carlo started. Yes; there was no mistaking the willful
mouth and the flashing defiant eyes. The little girl
who had sung so divinely in the Maestro’s dusty room
ten years ago was the new operatic “star.” But he
was not jealous of the Betisi as yet. He said the most
exquisite things—as only an Italian can say them—and
bowed over her hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Signorina has fulfilled the glorious promise of
her childhood and the prophecy of the Maestro,” he
said. “She who once sang like a cherub now sings like
an angel. I am dying to hear you!” he added.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah!” cried the Betisi with a little trill of laughter,
“if you are dying now, what will you do afterwards?”
The speech might have meant much or nothing, and,
though Carlo Gladiali winced a little, he made no comment.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>A few rehearsals later a cloud of snuff enveloped him,
and he was clasped in the arms of a brown great-coat
of antique design. Add, above, a gray woolen comforter
and a traveling cap with ear-pieces, and, below, a pair
of green trousers, ending in cloth boots with patent-leather
toecaps, and you have the portrait of the Maestro
in traveling costume.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Heaven be praised, my dear Carlino, that I have lived
to see this day!... Have you renewed acquaintance
with my little witch, my enchanted bird, my drop of
singing-water? Embrace, my children; your Maestro
wishes it!”</p>

<p class='c009'>And Gladiali touched the cheek of Emilia Betisi with
his lips. Her sparkling eyes looked mockingly into his.
Then the Maestro, who spoke not a word of English,
scrambled to the conductor’s chair, and commenced to
harangue the musicians who constituted the orchestra
in a fluent conglomeration of several other languages,
and the rehearsals of “Belverde” began.</p>

<p class='c009'>The new soprano and the new opera made an instantaneous
and unparalleled “hit.” Carlo helped to
pick up La Betisi’s bouquets, and made a pretty speech
to her at the final descent of the curtain. But his heart
was not in his eyes or on his lips.</p>

<p class='c009'>Upon the second representation, he yawned in the
middle of Isolina’s great aria, and he openly sneered at
the audience for encoring the song three times. In the
last Act, in the Garden Scene, which offered the principal
opportunity for the display of the new <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">prima donna’s</span></i>
art, Carlo sucked jujubes, and openly wore one in his
cheek while receiving, as Galantuomo, from the maddened
Isolina the most feverish protestations of love.
He noted something more than feigned frenzy in the
flaming black eyes of the Betisi at this juncture, and,
somewhat unwisely, permitted himself to smile. Next
moment he received a deep scratch upon the cheek,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>which tingled for a moment, then bled copiously, obliging
the tenor to sing the final Romanza with a handkerchief
to his face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Convey to Signor Gladiali my profoundest apologies,”
said the Betisi to her dresser. “He will really
think that he was singing a duet with a cat! But the
next performance goes better.” Her dark eyes gleamed,
her red lips smiled. She thirsted for the second representation.</p>

<p class='c009'>So did Carlo. He had thought out a few little things
calculated to drive a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cantatrice</span></i> to the pitch of desperation.
For instance, at the second encore of her great
song, separated only by a duet from <em>his</em> great song in
the First Act, he would fetch a chair and sit down.
Aha!</p>

<p class='c009'>But—whether his intention had leaked out through
Rebelli, to whom in a moment of champagne he had
confided it, or whether the Betisi was in league with demons,
let it be decided—it was she who fetched, not a
chair, but a three-legged stool, and sat down on it in
the middle of his first encore. And so charming an air
of patience did she assume, and so genuine seemed her
pity for the deluded public who had redemanded the
song, that Signor Carlo, who wore a strip of black Court
plaster on one cheek, nearly had an apoplexy. He
meant to eat jujubes through <em>her</em> great song, but the
Betisi was prepared. She produced a box and offered
them to him, singing all the while more brilliantly than
she had ever sung before; and when the house rose at
her in rapture and demanded an encore, she tripped
and fetched the three-legged stool and gave it, with a
triumphant curtsey, to the foaming Galantuomo. And
the crowded house roared with delight.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the punishment of Carlo came in the Second Act.
In the celebrated Garden Scene, where slighted love
drives Isolina into temporary madness, she not only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>scratched her Galantuomo on the other cheek, but pulled
his wig off. And in the crowning scene, where Isolina
reveals herself as the daughter of the King, and summons
the Court to witness the humiliation of Galantuomo
by beating on a gong which is suspended from a tree,
came the Betisi’s great opportunity. Running through
the most difficult passages of the arduous <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">scena</span></i> with the
greatest nonchalance, disposing of octaves, double octaves,
and ranging from <em>sol</em> to <em>si</em>-flat in the violin-clef
with the utmost ease, she electrified and enthralled her
hearers; and, in the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">gusto</span></i> of singing, when the moment
arrived for striking on the gong previously referred to,
she missed the instrument, and struck the tenor violently
upon the nose. The unfortunate organ attained pantomimic
dimensions within the few minutes that ensued
subsequently to the delivery of the blow and previous
to the falling of the curtain, and I have heard was
favored by the gallery with a special call.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Alas, Signor Carlo, I know not how to express my
regret!... I was carried away...” faltered the Betisi,
as with secret triumph and feigned remorse she
looked upon the tenor’s swollen nose.</p>

<p class='c009'>Carlo gave her a passionate glance over it. As it had
enlarged, so had his heart and his understanding; he
saw his enemy beautiful, triumphant—a Queen of Song.
He was conquered and her slave.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never mind my nose,” he said generously. “I am
beaten, fairly beaten, and with my own weapons. You
are a clever woman, Signora, and a great singer. Permit
me to take your hand.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There,” she said, and gave it. “And you, Signor,
are a magnificent artist, though I have sometimes thought
you a stupid man. What is it but stupidity—<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Dio!</span></i>”
she cried, “to be jealous of a woman of whom one is not
even the lover or the husband?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Give me the right to be jealous,” said Carlo the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>tenor. “Make me one and the other! Marry me, Emilia.
I adore you!”</p>

<p class='c009'>An atmosphere of snuff and mildew enveloped them,
as the Maestro, the date and design of whose evening
dress-suit baffled the antiquarian and enraptured the caricaturist,
embraced both the tenor and the soprano in
rapid succession.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Aha! <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mes enfants</span></i>, am I not a true prophet?” he
cried. “<em>Hasten to grow up</em>, I said to the little one ten
years ago, <em>and Carlo there shall one day sing Romeo to
thy Juliet</em>.” He embraced them again. “You sing like
angels—you quarrel like devils! Heaven intended you
for one another. Be happy!” And the Maestro blessed
the betrothed lovers with a sprinkling of snuff.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>THE TUG OF WAR</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Men invariably termed her “a sweet woman.” Women
called her other things.</p>

<p class='c009'>What was she like? Of middle height and “caressable,”
with a rounded, supple figure, exquisitely groomed
and got up! Her golden hair would have been merely
brown, if left to Nature. It came nearly to her eyebrows
in the dearest little rings, and was coaxed into
the loveliest of coils and waves and undulations. Her
eyes were lustrous hazel, her eyelashes and eyebrows
as nearly black as perfect taste allowed. Her cheeks
were of an ivory pallor, sometimes relieved with a faint
sea-shell bloom. Her features were beautifully cut, inclining
to the aquiline in outline. Her voice was low
and tender, especially when she was saying the sort of
thing that puts a young fellow out of conceit with the
girl he is engaged to, and makes the married man wonder
why he threw himself away. Why he was such
an infuriated ass, by George! as to beg and pray Clara
to marry him ten years ago, and buy a new revolver
when she said it was esteem she felt for him, not love.
Why Fate should ordain just at this particular juncture
that he should encounter the one woman, by jingo!
the only woman in the world who had ever really understood
and sympathized with him! It was Mrs. Osborne’s
vocation to make men of all grades, ranks, and ages
ask this question. She had followed her chosen path in
life with enthusiasm, let us say, collecting scalps, with
here and there a little shudder of pity, and here and there
a little smart of pain. Fascination, exercised almost involuntarily,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>was to her, as to the cobra, the means of
life. Not in a vulgar sense, because the late Colonel
Osborne had left his widow handsomely provided for.
But the excitement of the sport, the keen delight of
capturing new victims—bringing the quarry boldly down
in the open, or setting insidious snares, pitfalls, and traps
for the silly prey to blunder into—these joys the huntress
knows who sharpens her arrows and weaves her webs
for Man.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have said—or hinted—that other women did not
love Mrs. Osborne. Knowing, as they did, that the
lovely widow frankly despised them, her own sex responded
by openly declaring war. They knew her
strength, and never attacked her save in bands. Yet,
strange to say, the invincible Mrs. Osborne was never so
nearly worsted as in a single-handed combat to which
she was challenged by a mere neophyte—“a chit”—as,
had she lived in the eighteenth instead of the twentieth
century, the fair widow would have termed Polly Overshott.</p>

<p class='c009'>Polly’s real name was Mariana, but, as everyone in
the county said, Polly seemed more appropriate. Sir
Giles Overshott had no other child, and sometimes seemed
not to regret this limitation of his family circle. Lady
Overshott had been dead some five years when the story
opens, and Sir Giles was beginning to speak of himself
as a widower, which to experienced ears means much.</p>

<p class='c009'>The estate of Overshott Foxbrush was a fine one, unencumbered,
and yielding a handsome rent-roll. It was
understood that Polly would have nearly everything.
She had consented in the most daughterly manner to
become engaged to the eldest son of a county neighbor,
a young gentleman with whom she was very much in love,
Costebald Ianson Smithgill, commonly known as “Cis”
Smithgill, his united initials forming the caressing little
name. He was six feet high, and had a bass voice with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>treble inflections, which he was training for a parliamentary
career. He had, until the demise of an elder
brother removed him from the service of his country, held
a lieutenancy in the Guards. As to his family, who
does not know that the Smithgills are a family of extreme
antiquity, descended from that British Princess
and daughter of Vortigern who drank the health of Hengist,
proffering the Saxon General the mead-horn of welcome
when he first set his conquering foot on British
soil? Who does not know this, knows nothing. The
mead-horn is said to be enclosed in the masonry of the
eldest portion of Hengs Hall, the family seat in the
country of Mixshire, where, of course, the scene of our
story is laid. And Polly and Cis had been engaged
about two months when Mrs. Osborne took The Sabines,
and was called on by the county, because Osborne had
been the cousin of an Earl, and she herself came of a
very good family. You don’t want any name much
better than that of Weng. And Mrs. Osborne came of
the Wengs of Hollowshire.</p>

<p class='c009'>She took The Sabines for the sake of her health, which
required country air. It was an old-fashioned, square
Jacobean house of red brick faced with stone, and it
boasted a yew walk, the yews whereof had been wrought
by some long-moldered-away tree-clipper into arboreal
representatives of the Rape of the Sabines. That avenue
was one of the lions of the county, and every fresh
tenant of the place had to bind him or herself, under
fearful penalties, to keep the Sabine ladies and their
abductors properly clipped.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Osborne was destitute of the faculty of reverence,
Lady Smithgill of Hengs said afterwards. Because early
in June, when she drove over to call—it would not become
even a Smithgill to ignore a Weng of Hollowshire—upon
turning a curve in the avenue so as to command
the house, the lawn, and the celebrated Yew Tree Walk,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>the new tenant of The Sabines, exquisitely attired in a
Paris gown and carrying a marvelous guipure sunshade,
appeared to view; Sir Giles Overshott was with her, and
the lady and the baronet were laughing heartily.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mrs. Osborne <em>simply shrieked</em>,” Lady Smithgill said
afterwards, in confidence to a few dozen dear friends;
“and Sir Giles was quite purple—that unpleasant shade,
don’t you know?</p>

<p class='c009'>“It turned out that they were amusing themselves
at the expense of The Sabines. I looked at her, and I
fancy I showed my surprise at her want of taste.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘We think a great deal of them in the county,’ I
said, ‘and Sir Giles can tell you how severe a censure
would be pronounced by persons of taste upon the tenant
who was so audacious as to deface or so careless as to
neglect them, or even, ignorantly, to make sport of them.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“At that Sir Charles became a deeper shade, almost
violet, and she uncovered her eyes and smiled. I think
somebody has told her she resembled Bernhardt in her
youth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Dear Lady Smithgill,’ she said, or rather cooed (and
those cooing voices are so irritating!), ‘depend on it,
I shall make a point of keeping them in the most <em>perfect</em>
condition. To be obliged to pay a forfeit to my landlord
would be a nuisance, but to be censured by persons of
taste residing in the county, that would be quite insupportable.’
Then she rang for tea, and there were eight
varieties of little cakes, which must have been sent down
from Buszard’s, and a cut-glass liqueur bottle of rum
upon the tray. ‘Do you take rum?’ she had the audacity
to ask me. I did not stoop to decline verbally, but
shook my head slightly, and she gave me another of
<em>those smiles</em> and passed on the rum. Sir Charles brought
it me, and I waved it away, <em>speechless</em>, absolutely speechless,
at the monstrosity of the idea.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She overwhelmed me with apologies, of course.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>“And both Sir Giles—who, I regret to see, is constantly
there—and Sir Costebald, who has <em>once</em> called—consider
her a sweet woman. But—think me foreboding
if you will—I <em>cannot</em> feel that county Society has
an acquisition in Mrs. Osborne.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Papa goes to The Sabines rather often,” said Polly
Overshott, when it came to her turn to be the recipient
of Lady Smithgill’s confidence. “He does say that Mrs.
Osborne is a sweet woman, and he is helping her to choose
some brougham horses. He says the pair she brought
down are totally unfit for country roads. And as for
the rum, she offered it to me. Colonel Osborne held a
post in the Diplomatic Service at Berlin, and Germans
drink it in tea, and I rather like it, though a second
cup gives you a headache afterwards.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mary!” screamed Miss Overshott’s mamma-in-law
elect, who had effected this compromise between Polly
and Mariana.</p>

<p class='c009'>“As regards The Sabines,” Polly went on, “we have
bowed down before them for years and years, and we
shall go on doing it, but they are absurd all the same.
So are our lead groups and garden temples at Overshott—awfully
absurd——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose you include our Saxon buttress and Roman
pavement at Hengs in the catalogue of absurdities,”
said Lady Smithgill icily. “Fortunately, Sir
Costebald is not a widower, or they might stand in some
danger of being swept away. At the present moment,
let me tell you, Mary, your lead figures and garden
temples are far from secure. That woman leads your
father by the nose—twines him round her little finger.
Cis tells me——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What does Cis know about it?” said Polly, flushing
to the temples.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cis is a man of the world,” said Lady Smithgill.
“But at the same time he is a dutiful son. He tells
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>everything to his mother. It seems—Cis personally
vouches for the truth of this—that Sir Giles is constantly
at The Sabines—in fact, every day.... He is dressed
for conquest, it would appear.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cis or Papa?” asked Polly, with feigned innocence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sir Giles wears coats and neckties that would be condemned
as showy if worn by a bridegroom,” said Lady
Smithgill rapidly. “He is perfumed with expensive extracts,
and his boots must be torture, Cis says, knowing
all one does know of the Overshott tendency to gout.
He never removes his eyes from Mrs. Osborne, laughs
to idiocy at everything she says, and simply <em>lives</em> in the
corner of the sofa next her. He monopolizes the conversation.
Nobody else can get in a word, Cis tells me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Since when did Cis begin to be jealous?” said Polly
under her breath.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I did not quite catch your remark,” returned Lady
Smithgill. “By the way, Mary, I hope you will wear
those pearls as often as you can. They require air, sunshine,
and exercise.... I contracted my chronic rheumatic
tendency thirty years ago through sitting in the
garden with them on. For days together Sir Costebald’s
mother used to <em>skip</em> in them upon the terrace, but I
never went as far as that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The pearls—what pearls?” asked Polly vaguely.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dear Mary, when a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fiancé</span></i> makes a gift of such beauty—to
say nothing of its value—and the strings were originally
purchased for two thousand pounds—it is customary
for the recipient to exhibit a <em>little</em> appreciation,”
Lady Smithgill returned.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Appreciation!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course you thanked Cis, my dear. I never doubted
that. But there, we will say no more....”</p>

<p class='c009'>Polly’s blue eyes flashed. She rose up; she had ridden
over to the Hall alone, and her slight upright figure
looked its best in a habit.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>“I should like to say a little more.” She put up
her hand and unpinned her hat from her close braids
of yellow-gold, and tossed the headgear into a neighboring
chair. “Dear Lady Smithgill, Cis has not given
me any pearls. Perhaps he has sent them to Bond Street
to be cleaned——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cleaned! They are in perfect condition.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Or—or perhaps he has given them to some one else.
I have seen very little of Cis lately,” Polly ended. “But
Papa tells me that he is a good deal at The Sabines.
Papa seemed to find him as much in the way as ... as
Cis found Papa. And—her new kitchenmaid is the sister
of our laundrywoman, and a report reached me that
she had lately been wearing some magnificent pearls....
I thought nothing of it at the time, but now....”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a snorting gasp from Lady Smithgill. All
had been made clear. Her double chin trembled, and
her eyes went wild.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mary!” she cried.... “I have been blind! My boy—my
infatuated boy! That woman has a positively
fiendish power over men.... She will enslave—ensnare
Cis as she has done your father and dozens of
others. Oh! my dear, there are stories.... She is
relentless. The Sowersea’s second son, De la Zouch
Sowersea, is now driving a cab in Melbourne, and the
Countess attributes everything to her. At Berlin—where
her husband had a diplomatic appointment, and
she learned to offer refined English-women rum in their
tea—there were worse scandals—agitations, duels! Now
my son is in peril. Save him, Mary! Do something
before it is too late!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can hardly drop in at The Sabines—say I have
called for my property, and take Cis and Papa away,”
said Polly, her short upper lip quivering with pain and
anger. “But I will think over what is best to be done.
In the meantime do not worry Cis. Leave him to go his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>way. We need not be too nervous. He and Papa will
keep an eye upon each other,” she ended.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You know more of this than you have told me,”
poor Lady Smithgill gasped. “There are scandals in
the air—people are talking—about my boy and that woman!
Why did she ever come here?” the unhappy lady
murmured. “I said from the first that she would be no
acquisition to the county!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Polly’s cob, Kiss-me-Quick, came round, and Polly took
leave. She had warm young blood in her veins, and an
imperious temper of her own, and to be asked to “do
something” to add a fresh access of caloric to the obviously
cooling temperature of one’s betrothed is not flattering.
Yes, she had suspected before; yes, she had
known more than she had told the proprietress of the
agitated double chin and the agitated maternal feelings.
Sir Giles had betrayed Cis as unconsciously as he had
betrayed himself. “Really, Poll, I think you ought to
keep the young man better to heel,” he had said. “He
means no harm, but Mrs. Osborne is a dangerously fascinating
woman, and a woman of that type possesses advantages
over a girl. And, of course, I don’t suggest
anything in the nature of disloyalty to yourself—Cis is
the soul of honor and all that. But to see an engaged
young fellow sitting on footstools, and lying on the grass
at the feet of a pretty woman—who doesn’t happen to be
the <em>right one</em>—turning up his eyes at her like a dying
duck in a thunderstorm—by George!—irritates me. He
is always in Mrs. Osborne’s pocket, and one never can
get a word with her alone—I mean, nobody is allowed
to usurp her attention for an instant. And here is the
key to the Crackle-Room, since you are asking for it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And Sir Giles handed his daughter the key in question,
a slim, rusty implement belonging to the showroom
of Overshott, an octagonal boudoir, periodically
dusted and swept by the housekeeper’s reverent hands,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>but otherwise untouched, since Lady Barbara Overshott,
the friend and correspondent of Pope and Addison, was
found by her distracted husband sitting stone dead at
her spinet before the newly-copied score of the “Ode on
Saint Cecilia’s Day,” which had been sent her with the
united compliments of the author and the composer. The
furniture of the boudoir was of the reign of William
and Mary, the walls panelled with pink lacquer beaded
with ormolu, the shelves, brackets and cabinets laden
with priceless specimens of crackle ware—the joy of the
connoisseur and the envy of the collector.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you,” said Polly, taking the key. “I was
anxious to see for myself how many of Lady Bab’s vases
and bowls are left to us.” She looked very tall and
very fair, and rather terrifying as she confronted Sir
Giles. They were in the hall of Overshott, the doors
of which stood wide open to the faint September breeze
and the hot September sunshine, and Sir Giles, who was
going to luncheon at The Sabines, was putting on a
thin dust-coat in preparation for the drive. He jumped
at the reference to the crackle.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose Mrs. Brownlow has told you that I have
removed a piece or two,” he said, bungling with the
sleeves of his dust-coat, for lack of the daughterly hitch
at the back of the collar which would have induced the
refractory garment to go on.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mrs. Brownlow has told me that a baker’s dozen of
bowls and vases and plaques and teapots—the cream of
the collection, in fact,” said Polly, “are adorning Mrs.
Osborne’s drawing-room.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Confound it!” said Sir Giles, as he struggled with
his garment. “The crockery isn’t entailed; and if I desire
to give a teapot to a friend I suppose I can do as I
like with my own! And—I can’t keep the cart waiting.
Fanchon won’t stand.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Undoubtedly,” said Polly, becoming cool as Sir Giles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>grew warm. “Only—if you are going on giving teapots
to friends, and there is a hamper of china at this moment
under the seat of the cart—I think it would be advisable
to change the name of the Crackle-Room. One might call
it the ‘Plundered Apartment,’ or something equally appropriate.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Call it what you choose, my dear.” Sir Giles was
now recovering from the shock of the unexpected onslaught.
“I have said the crackle is no more entailed
than Overton Foxshott or the Lowndes Square house—or
anything else that at present I may call my own. If
I were a younger man, I might plunder my mother and
disappoint my promised wife for the pleasure of making
a considerable present of jewelry to a woman ten years
my senior. As it is——”</p>

<p class='c009'>Sir Giles did not finish the speech, but strode angrily
out and got into the cart, and gave Polly a short, gruff
“Good-bye,” as he drove away, leaving that puzzled
young woman on the doorsteps.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Plunder my mother and disappoint my promised
wife.... Present of jewelry ... a woman ten years
his senior.’... Can Cis have been giving jewels to Mrs.
Osborne?” Polly wondered. The course of her love affair
had run so smoothly that she was at a loss to account
for the pain at her heart and the fever in her veins. Sir
Giles’s complaint she diagnosed correctly. He was jealous ...
jealous of Cis! He was angry with Polly. He
had reminded her that he could do as he liked with his
own, that the county might call her an heiress, but the
county had no certain grounds for the assertion. Jealous
and angry, the dear, cheery Dad. Because Cis chose
to loll upon the grass at the skirts of a woman who was
his senior by many more years than ten. Polly ordered
round Kiss-me-Quick, and rode over to Hengs Hall, pondering
these things in her mind. Much had been revealed
to her, but it was for Lady Smithgill to lift the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>last corner of the veil and disclose to Cis’s future wife
the true meaning of Sir Giles’s reference to jewels.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So Cis gave her the pearls, and Dad has given her
the crackle to recover lost ground. Mrs. Osborne must
be a clever woman,” Polly reflected, as she rode slowly
home through the sunset lanes on Kiss-me-Quick.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How was it going to end, all this?</p>

<p class='c009'>“If Dad married Mrs. Osborne, it will be extremely
unpleasant to possess a stepmother who has been made
love to by one’s husband. And should Mrs. Osborne succeed
in marrying Cis——” Polly tightened the reins
involuntarily, and Kiss-me-Quick quickened her paces.
“Let her, if she wants him. No; let him if he wants
her. But first—oh, first—there will be a Tug of War!
I will not endure to be routed on my own ground by
this designing charlataness,” thought Polly.</p>

<p class='c009'>In London it might have happened—almost without
remark. But here—here in the open—under familiar
pitying, curious eyes.... Never, never, never! And
with each repetition of the word Kiss-me-Quick danced
at a cut of the whip. For Polly was humane, yet human.</p>

<p class='c009'>The double report of a gun in one of the Heng coppices
gave Kiss-me-Quick an excuse for more dancing,
and presently, as Polly looked, shading her blue eyes
with her half-gauntleted right hand, Cis and a keeper
came plainly into view. She pulled up Kiss-me-Quick
and waited, as the young man, leaving his gun with the
keeper, crossed the hot stubbles dangling a brace of
birds.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, Polly dear!” He tried to look natural and at
ease as he lifted his leather cap from his crisp brown
waves. “If you had told me you thought of riding over
to see the mother, I’d have called for you and brought
you over.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was a sudden idea, Cis,” Polly said, as she gave
him her gloved hand.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>“Can you tie these birds on the saddle—or shall I send
them over?” asked Cis, glad of an excuse that made it
possible to fix his eyes below the level of hers. “They’re
clean shot,” he added.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fasten them on—there’s a strap in the saddle pocket—and
I will leave them at The Sabines as I pass!” said
Polly cheerfully.</p>

<p class='c009'>Cis’s jaw dropped: he turned pale under his sun tan.
“Leave them at The Sabines!” he repeated blankly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I thought,” said Polly, bending a cool, amused
glance upon her lover’s perturbed countenance, “that
you meant them for Mamma. To be sure, she is not
Mamma yet, but it is a pretty compliment to treat her as
though she were already Papa’s wife—taking the pearls
to show her before you brought them to me! I call it
<em>quite sweet</em> of you!” Polly ended.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—I!” The young man’s face was an extraordinary
study. “I am so glad you’re pleased,” he stuttered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dad is with her to-day,” went on Polly, stroking
Kiss-me-Quick’s glossy neck with her whip-lash. “He
took her over a cargo of crackle china out of Lady Bab’s
room. China is a taste one begins to cultivate at her
age, dear thing, and I suppose they are having a nice,
quiet, cosy afternoon, arranging the pieces. She has her
fads, Dad has his, and I am sure they will get on excellently
together. Dear me! how warm you are! Come
to tea to-morrow! Good-bye!”</p>

<p class='c009'>And Polly rode quickly away. Sore as she was, angry
and jealous as she was, she laughed as the vision of Cis’s
hot, astonished, indignant face rose before her. She
laughed again as she turned in at the bridle-gate of The
Sabines. But she was grave and earnest as she dismounted
at the hall-door and followed Ames, the butler,
down the long, cool hall to the drawing-room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Miss Overshott.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>The announcement made Sir Giles attempt to get up
from the footstool on which he was sitting, but he did
not succeed at the first attempt, thanks to his rheumatism,
and his daughter’s eye lighted on him at once.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t move, Dad, dearest. Why should you? Oh!
Mrs. Osborne!” Polly flew to the fair widow, who advanced,
cool, smiling, and exquisitely clad, to greet her
visitor. “Oh, Mrs. Osborne, I am so—so glad!” Polly
seemed choking with joyful tears as she caught the
rounded waist of Melusine in her strong young embrace,
and vigorously kissed the exquisitely powdered cheeks.
“And I may call you Mamma—mayn’t I?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mamma?” echoed Sir Giles, sitting puzzled on the
footstool.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mamma?” re-echoed Mrs. Osborne in cooing accents
of surprise.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You see, Dad has told me all,” explained Polly, turning
beaming, childlike eyes of happiness upon the embarrassed
pair. “Though Cis knew before I did, and I
hardly call that quite fair. But as he is to be your son,
dear Mrs. Osborne—as I am to be your daughter——Why,
there is the crackle arranged upon your cabinets
already! How nice it looks! But it will all be yours,
presently, won’t it, Mamma?” Polly gave Mrs. Osborne
another kiss, and then fluttered over to Sir Giles,
who sat petrified upon the footstool, and gave him a
couple. “You mustn’t be jealous,” she said, “you foolish
old Dad! And now, Mamma darling, won’t you give
me some tea?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dear Mary, with pleasure!” assented Mrs. Osborne,
who knew that her hand had been forced, and yet could
not help admiring the audacity of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup</span></i>. As her
graceful form undulated to the tea-table, she cast a glance
at Sir Giles, raising her beautifully tinted eyebrows almost
to her golden-brown curls. She gave him credit
for being a party to the plot, while he, poor astonished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>gentleman, was as innocent as a new-born babe. In the
passing out of a cup of tea she realized that a double
game was no longer possible, and that Polly Overshott
had the stronger hand. “Your father,” she said, as she
gave Polly her tea, “has enlisted a powerful advocate.
All was not so settled as you seem to think, dear Mary,
but——” And she sighed, and extended her white hand
to Sir Giles, and helped him up from the footstool; and
he was in the act of gracefully kissing that fair hand as
Cis, in riding-dress, pale, agitated, and breathless from
the gallop over, was ushered in.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cis!” cried Polly, realizing that the supreme moment
of the Tug of War was now or never. Her eyes were
blue fires, her cheeks red ones, as she moved swiftly and
gracefully to her lover and led him forward. “Kiss
Mamma and shake hands with Dad,” she said, and added
with a coquetry of which Cis had never thought her capable:
“and then, perhaps, you may kiss me.” Bewildered,
choking with the reproaches, the recriminations
with which he was bursting, and which it need hardly
be explained were intended for Mrs. Osborne’s private
ear, the young man obeyed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—I congratulate you both,” he said thickly. Mrs.
Osborne had never felt so little the niceties of a situation
in her life. Nonplused, angry, and perturbed, she
looked every hour of her age, despite pink curtains; and
the powder only served to accentuate the suddenly revealed
hollows in her face. Polly, as I have explained,
had never worn such an air of coquetry, of brilliancy,
of dare-devil, defiant mastery as she now displayed. But
her final blow was to be dealt—and she dealt it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mamma darling,” she cooed, taking the vacated stool
at Mrs. Osborne’s feet—the stool contested for by both
the discomfited wooers—“how cosy we are here—all together!
Won’t you please Dad—and me—and Cis—by
bringing out the pearls!”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>“The—pearls!” Mrs. Osborne said. An electric shock
went through her; she turned stabbing eyes upon the
speechless Cis. And Sir Giles, studying her face, made
up his mind that he would never marry that woman—not
if Polly did her level best to bring the match about.</p>

<p class='c009'>While Polly prattled on.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The pearls, of course. I told Cis I thought it sweet
of him to bring them to show you—as though I were
really your daughter, don’t you know. And if you will
fasten them round my neck yourself, I shall think it
sweet of you. Where have you hidden them? Why, I
believe you are wearing them now—to keep them warm
for me—under your lace cravat, you dear, darling
thing!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The affectionate daughter-elect raised a guileless hand
and twitched the jewels into sight.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Osborne, ashy pale, and with Medea-like eyes, unfastened
the jewels from her throat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here they are, dear Mary. Take them—and may
they bring you all the happiness I wish you!” said Mrs.
Osborne in cooing accents.</p>

<p class='c009'>Polly could not restrain a little shudder, but she was
grave.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now Cis and I will go,” she said, when the pearls
were fastened round her neck over the neat white collar.
“I am sure you and Dad want to be alone. Come, Cis
dear.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And she kissed Mrs. Osborne again, and bore Cis—not
unwilling, strangely fascinated by the new Polly so suddenly
made manifest—away. They were riding slowly
home to dinner at Overshott Foxbrush, when the sound
of wheels rattling behind them, and Fanchon’s well-known
trot, brought a covert smile to Polly’s lips.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Osborne had a headache, Sir Giles explained, and
so he had decided not to remain to dinner.</p>

<p class='c009'>But father, daughter, and betrothed dined pleasantly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>at Overshott Foxbrush. And when the dazzled Cis said
good-night to the triumphant Polly, the valediction was
uttered unwillingly with as many repetitions as there
were pearls in the string Miss Overshott wore round her
firm white throat.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no gas laid on at Overshott. Bedroom candlesticks
were an unabolished institution. As Sir Giles
gave his daughter hers, he spoke.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You were a little premature in your conclusions, my
girl, at The Sabines to-day. I won’t ask why you played
that little comedy, because I know.... But you played
it well ... and I don’t think Cis will kick over the
traces in that direction again. Nor do I think”—the
Colonel cleared his throat rather awkwardly—“that you
are going to have Mrs. Osborne for your second mother.
She is too clever—and so are you! Good-night, my
dear!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c005'>GAS!</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Gudrun’s season at the Sceptre Theatre was drawing
to a finish, and the funds of the Syndicate were in
the same condition. Teddy Candelish—Teddy of the
cherubic smile and the golden mustache, constantly described
by the <cite>Theatrical Piffer</cite> as the most ubiquitous
of acting-managers—sat in his sanctum before an American
roll-top desk, checking off applications for free seats
and filing unpaid bills. Gormleigh, the stage-director,
balanced himself on the end of a saddle-bag sofa, chewing
an unlighted cigar; De Hanna, the representative
of the Syndicate, was going over the books at a leather-covered
table, his eyeglasses growing dim in the attempt
to read anything beyond deficit in those neatly kept columns.
Mrs. Gudrun occupied the easiest chair. Her
feet, beautifully silk-stockinged and wonderfully shod,
occupied the next comfortable; her silken draperies were
everywhere, and a cigarette was between her finely cut
lips. Her feather boa hung from an electric-globe branch,
and her flowery diaphanous hat, bristling with diamond-headed
pins, crowned the domelike brow of a plaster bust
of the Bard of Avon.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” said the manageress, making smoke-rings and
looking at De Hanna, “there’s no putting the bare fact
to bed! We’ve not pulled off things as we had a right to
expect.... We’ve lost our little pot, and come to the
end of our resources, eh?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In plain terms,” said De Hanna, speaking through
his nose, as he always did when upon the subject of
money, “the Syndicate has run you for all the Syndicate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>is worth, and when we pay salaries on Saturday we
shall have”—he did some figuring with a lead pencil
on the back of a millionaire’s request for gratuitous
stalls, and whistled sadly—“something like four hundred
and fifty left to carry us through until the seventeenth.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We began with as nice a little nest-egg as any management
could wish for,” said Candelish, dropping a
smoking vesta into the waste-paper basket with fatalistic
unconcern. “We thought <cite>The Stone Age</cite> would pay.
I’d my doubts of a prehistoric drama in five acts and
fourteen scenes that couldn’t be produced under an outlay
of four thousand pounds, but we were overruled.”
He veered the tail of his eye round at Mrs. Gudrun.
“You and the Duke were mad about that piece.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“De Petoburgh saw great possibilities for me in it,”
said Mrs. Gudrun, throwing another cigarette-end at the
fireplace and missing it. “That scene where Kaja comes
in dressed in woad for battle, and brains What’s-his-name
with her prehistoric stone ax because he doesn’t
want to fight her, always thrilled him. He said I would
be greater than Siddons in it, and, well—you remember
the notices I got in the <cite>Morning Whooper</cite>. Cluffer did
me justice <em>then</em>, if he did turn nasty afterward—the
beast!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“When I met Cluffer in the vestibule on the first night
after the third act,” said Teddy Candelish, “he said he
was going home because the tension of your acting was
positively too great to bear. He preferred me to describe
the rest of the play to him, and jotted the chief
points on his cuff before he went. And I grant you the
notice was a ripper, but it didn’t seem to bring people
in; and after playing to paper for three weeks, we had
to put up the fortnight’s notice and jam <cite>The Kiss of
Clytie</cite> into rehearsal.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dad vos a lofely—ach!—a lofely blay!” moaned Oscar
Gormleigh, casting up his little pig’s eyes to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>highly ornamental ceiling of the managerial sanctum.
“Brigged from de Chairman in de pekinning, as I told
you, as all de goot blays are.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish the Germans had stuck to it, I’m sure,” said
De Hanna. “It always appeared to me too much over
the heads of ordinary intelligent playgoers to pay worth
a little damn.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“De dranscendental element——” Gormleigh was beginning,
when Mrs. Gudrun cut him short.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I never cared for it very much myself; but Bob Bolsover
was dead set upon my giving the public my reading
of <em>Clytie</em>—and, well, you must recollect the effect I created
in that studio scene. Mullekens came round afterward,
and brought his critic with him, and said that the
best French school of acting must now look to its laurels,
and a lot more. Mullekens is the proprietor of the <cite>Daily
Tomahawk</cite>, and so, of course, I thought we were in for a
good thing. How could I imagine that the creature of a
critic would go home and make game of the whole show?
Doesn’t Mullekens pay him?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, ja! Poot dat gritic’s vife is de sister of de Chairman
agtress dat blayed <em>Glytie</em> in de orichinal Chairman
broduction,” put in Gormleigh, whose real surname was
Gameltzch, as everybody does not know. “Did I not
varn you? It vas a gase of veels vidin veels.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wheels or no wheels, <em>Clytie</em> kissed us out of three
thou. odd,” said De Hanna, wearily scratching his ear
with his “Geyser” pen, “and then we cut our throats
with——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“With him,” put in Candelish, jerking a contemptuous
thumb at the hat-crowned effigy of the Bard of
Avon.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You were keen on my giving the great mass of playgoers
a chance of seeing my Juliet,” remarked Mrs.
Gudrun casting a Parthian glance at the worm that had
turned.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>“But they didn’t take the chance,” put in De Hanna,
“and consequently—we fizzle out.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Like a burst bladder ...” moaned Candelish, who
saw before him a weary waste of months unenlivened by
paid occupation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Or a damp sguib,” put in Gormleigh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s have a sputter before we expire,” said De
Hanna, with a momentary revival of energy. “Lots of
manuscripts have been sent in.... Isn’t there a little
domestic drama of the purely popular sort, or a farce
imbecile enough to pay for production, to be found among
’em?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dunno,” yawled Candelish, tilting his chair.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who is supposed to read the plays that are sent in?”
asked De Hanna, turning his large Oriental eyes toward.
Mrs. Gudrun.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I read some,” said the lady languidly, “and the dogs
get the rest.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She stretched, and an overpowering combination of
fashionable perfumes, shaken from her draperies, filled
the apartment. The three men sneezed simultaneously.
Mrs. Gudrun rose with majesty, and going to the mantel-glass,
patted her transformation fringe into form, and
smiled at the perennially beautiful image that smiled and
patted back. Suddenly there was a whining and scratching
outside the door.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s Billy. Let him in, one of you,” ordered the
manageress.</p>

<p class='c009'>All three men obeyed, clashing their heads together
smartly at the portal. De Hanna, with watering eyes,
opened the door, and a brindled bull of surpassing ugliness
trotted into the office, carrying a chewed brown
paper parcel decorated with futile red seals and trailing
loops of string. Lying down in the center of the carpet
and carefully arranging the parcel between his forepaws,
Billy proceeded to worry it.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>“Vot has de beast kott dere?” asked Gormleigh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Take it from him and see!” said Mrs. Gudrun carelessly.
Gormleigh’s violet nose became pale lavender as
Billy, looking up from the work of destruction, emitted
a loud growl.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He understonds everyding vot you say!” spluttered
the stage-manager.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Try him with German,” advised De Hanna.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Or mit Yiddish,” retorted Gormleigh spitefully.</p>

<p class='c009'>As De Hanna winced under the retort, Candelish, who
had rummaged unnoticed in a drawer for some moments,
produced a biscuit. Billy, watching out of the corner of
his eye, pricked a ragged ear and whacked the carpet
with his muscular tail.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hee, boy, hee, Billy!” Candelish said seductively.
Billy rose upon his powerful bow-legs and hung out his
tongue expectantly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Koot old Pillee!” uttered Gormleigh encouragingly.
“Gleffer old poy!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Billy vouchsafed the stage-manager not a glance; his
bloodshot eyes were glued upon the biscuit as he stood
over the brown paper parcel. Then, as Candelish, throwing
an expression of eager voracity into his countenance,
made believe to eat the coveted delicacy himself, Billy
made a step forwards.... The end of the parcel projected
from between his hind-legs.... De Hanna softly
stepped to the fireplace and seized the tongs....</p>

<p class='c009'>“Poo’ boy—poo’ ol’ Billy, then!” coaxed the acting-manager.
He broke the biscuit with one inviting snap,
Billy forgot the parcel, and De Hanna grabbed and got
it. The next moment the bull, realizing his loss, pinned
the representative of the Syndicate by the leg.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dash—dash—dash! Take the dash brute off, somebody!”
shrieked De Hanna.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a brief scene of confusion. Then, as Billy
retired under a corner table with a mouthful of ravished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>tweed, “He’s torn a piece out of your trow-trows, old
man,” Candelish remarked sympathetically.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He might have torn all the veins out of my leg!” De
Hanna gasped.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Den,” said Gormleigh, chuckling, “you would haf
been Kosher.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But Mrs. Gudrun was deeply disappointed in Billy.
“Letting you off for a bit of cloth!” she said. “Why,
the breed are famous for their bite. He ought to have
taken a piece of flesh clean out—I shall never believe in
that dog again!” She swept over to Gormleigh, who
was busy disentangling the lengths of chewed string and
removing the tatters of brown paper from Billy’s treasure-trove.
It proved to be a green-covered, rather bulky
volume of typescript. A red-bordered label gummed on
the cover announced its title:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>“MAGGS AT MARGATE</div>
    <div><span class='sc'>A Seaside Farce,</span></div>
    <div><span class='sc'>In Three Whiffs of Ozone.</span>”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“What funny fool has written this?” snorted the
manageress.</p>

<p class='c009'>“De name of de author.... Ach so! De name of de
author is Slump—Ferdinand Slump.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know the chap, or of him. He’s a business man
who owns a half share in some chemical gasworks at
Hackney, and does comic literature in off hours. He
writes the weekly theatrical page of <cite>Tickles</cite>,” said De
Hanna, “and——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Dickles</em> is a stupid halfpenny brint,” said Gormleigh,
“dat sdeals all its chokes from de Chairman babers.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Really? It struck me that there must be some existing
reason,” said Candelish, “for the wonderfully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>level flow of dullness the publication manages to maintain——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I suppose somebody is going to read this farce,
since that is what he calls it, by this Slump, since that is
what he calls himself,” said Mrs. Gudrun, removing her
hat from Shakespeare and pinning it on.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly. De Hanna, as the Representative of the
Syndicate——” began Candelish eagerly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pardon me. As acting-manager,” objected De
Hanna, “you, Candelish, have the prior claim.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Didn’t you say you were going out of town to-night,
Gormleigh?” interrupted Mrs. Gudrun, who had stuck in
all her hatpins, and was now putting on her gloves.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Choost for a liddle plow,” admitted Gormleigh.
“Dere is a cheab night drain to Stinkton-on-Sea, sdarding
from de Creat Northern at dwelve dirty. I shall
sleep in de gorridor gombardmend, oond breakfast at a
goffee and vinkle stall on de peach to-morrow morgen.
By vich I haf poot von night to pay for at de hotel.”
His bearded lips parted in a childlike smile of delight.
“My vife goes not vid me,” he said, and smiled again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then take this!” said Mrs. Gudrun, turning Slump’s
farce over. “Report on it after the show on Monday.”
And she rustled from the office on billows of silk, attended
by clouds of perfume, the despised Billy, and
the assiduous Candelish. The stage-manager swore. De
Hanna, concealing the solution in the continuity of his
tweeds with a bicycle trouser-clip, grinned.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A little solid reading will steady you down, Gummy,
and if my experience of Slump goes for anything—you’ve
got it there. But you’ll report on Monday, as
Her Nibs ordered. If you’ve not read it, look out for
squalls on Monday night!”</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c009'>“Potstausend! Hof I read dot farce!” gasped Gormleigh
on the night of Monday. “Schwerlich! I hof read
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>him tvice. Once from de beginning to de end, oond
akain from de end to de beginning.” His face assumed
an expression of anguish, and the veins on his bald forehead
stood out as the thick drops gathered there. “I
cannot make heads or dails of him.... He is gram-jam
with chokes, poot I cannot lof at dem; his situations
are sgreaming, poot I cannot sgream. De tears day
komm instead.... Dat vork is vonderful ... it
should one day be broduced, poot in de kreat National
School Theatre for authors oond actors dot de gountry
hos not yet founded, to brove to bubils vot is not a
farce——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yet I shouldn’t be surprised if we did the piece
here,” said Teddy Candelish. “Slump, the author, has
been talking over Her Nibs, and as he would let <cite>Maggs
at Margate</cite> go for nothing down, find three hundred
pounds toward the production, and merely take a nominal
sixty per cent., the chances are that you’ll be rehearsing
before Tuesday. Hullo!” for the stage-manager
had reeled heavily against him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ich bin unwohl.... It is dose undichested chokes
of Slumps I haf hodd on my gonstitution since I read
dot farce. Oond now you komm mit anodder,” Gormleigh
groaned.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here’s Her Nibs with Slump,” said Candelish, with
a grin; and Mrs. Gudrun, in the Renaissance robes of
Juliet, swept into the green room with a little grinning,
long-haired man in an imitation astrachan-collared overcoat
over crumpled evening dress—a little man who
gave a large hand, with mourning nails, familiarly to
Candelish, and nodded cavalierly when Gormleigh was
introduced. Slump was to read his play to the manageress
and her staff after the performance that night.</p>

<p class='c009'>Read his play Slump did, and Cimmerian gloom gathered
upon the countenances of his listeners as the first
act dragged to a close. Slump put the typescript down
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>on the supper-table and looked round; Gormleigh’s head
had sunk upon his folded arms. Heavy snores testified
to the depth and genuineness of his slumbers. The countenances
of De Hanna and Candelish expressed the most
profound dejection, while the intellectual half of Mrs.
Gudrun’s celebrated countenance had temporarily vanished
behind her upper lip.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you say to that?” Slump asked, quite undismayed
by these signs of weariness on the part of his
listeners. Mrs. Gudrun came back to answer him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I say that it’s the longest funeral I’ve ever been at.
Open another bottle of the Boy, Teddy, and wake up,
Gormleigh.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hof not been asleep,” explained Gormleigh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish I had,” sighed De Hanna. “The fact is,”
he continued, prompted by a glance from Mrs. Gudrun,
“that your play don’t do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Slump maintained, in the face of this discouragement,
a smiling front.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Won’t do, eh?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Won’t do for nuts,” said De Hanna firmly. “Nobody
could possibly laugh at it,” he continued.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is too tam tismal,” put in Gormleigh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But if I prove to you that people can laugh at it,
what then?” queried the undismayed Slump. He took
from a fob pocket-book a newspaper cutting and handed
it across the supper-table to De Hanna. The cutting
was headed</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>“OZONE AT THE BALL,”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>and ran thus:</p>

<p class='c014'>“‘Will you take a little refreshment?’</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Thank you, I have just had a sniff of ozone.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“Question and answer at the ball given last night in
aid of the —— Hospital, —— Square, at the Royal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>Rooms, Kensington. For, besides champagne, ozone was
laid on. After every dance Dr. Blank, head of the Hospital,
wheeled about the hall an appliance in which, by
electrical action, pure oxygen was converted into the invigorating
element of mountain or seaside air, greatly to
the purifying and enlivening of the atmosphere of the
ballroom.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“My firm supplies the gas used in the treatment of the
patients at that hospital,” said Slump. “It’s a turnover
of ten thousand per annum. We’re ready to lay it on
at the theater, and give the playgoers genuine ozone with
their evening’s entertainment. As for the farce, I don’t
count it A1 quality, but I’ve made up my mind to be
acted and laughed at, and I’m going to bring chemistry
in to help me. Think what an advertisement for the
hoardings: ‘Real Ozone Wafted Over the Footlights,’
‘Sea Air in the Stalls and Gallery!’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“By thunder! it’s a whacking notion!” cried Candelish.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Colossal!” exclaimed De Hanna, taking fire at last.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Poot vill de beoble loff?” asked Gormleigh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, yes! Will they stand your farce even with an
ozone accompaniment?” doubted Mrs. Gudrun.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve a machine downstairs in the stage-door office,”
said Slump calmly. “Will you try the first act over
again—with gas?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gormleigh groaned, but the other three nodded acquiescence;
and the men in charge of the electrical oxygen-generator
received instructions to bring the machine
upstairs.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c009'>“Ha, ha, ha!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Haw, haw, haw!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ach, it is too funny for anydings!” This from
Gormleigh, rocking in his chair, and mopping his streaming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>eyes with a red silk handkerchief. “Ach, ha, ha,
ha!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Gudrun held up her jeweled hands for mercy.
The laughing man who worked the machine stopped
pumping, the laughing author ceased to read, Billy the
bulldog, who had been grinning from ear to ear, wiped
a wet nose on his mistress’s gown and sat down panting.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How the deuce,” gasped De Hanna, “can oxygen
make a stupid farce a funny one? I can’t understand
it, for the life of me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because,” replied Slump, with brevity and clearness,
“that’s my trade secret, and I don’t mean to give
it away. Well, does <cite>Maggs</cite> go on, or do I take it to another
management?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The general assent was flattering in its unanimity.
<cite>Maggs at Margate</cite> went into rehearsal at the “Sceptre”
next day, and in a week was presented to the public.
We refer you to the critiques published in the <cite>Daily
Tomahawk</cite>, the <cite>Yelper</cite>, and other morning prints:</p>

<p class='c014'>“It seems as though the good old days were come
again.... Peals of irresistible laughter rang through
the crowded theater as the side-splitting story of <cite>Maggs</cite>
was unfolded. The audience laughed, the orchestra
laughed, the actors themselves were infected by the general
merriment.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mr. Slump is a public benefactor. When ‘down,’ a
dose of him will be found to act like magic. The management’s
happy notion of supplying the theater with
real ozone adds not a little to the pleasure of the entertainment.”</p>

<p class='c014'>And so forth, and so forth. Booking was immense,
the box-office and libraries were besieged with applicants
eager to breathe the genuine sea air wafted over the footlights
at the “Sceptre.” The treasury boxes had to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>carried to the office at night by two of the strongest
commissionaires.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Slump has a soft snap,” said De Hanna, chewing his
Geyser pen rapturously as he went over the books.
“Sixty per cent. of the gross receipts in author’s fees,
and we’re averaging two thousand a week since we went
in for daily <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">matinées</span></i>. Then the Transatlantic Trust is
running the play in New York to phenomenal business,
and we’ve planted it out for the Colonies, while France
and Germany——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Id vas from Chairmany dat de leading itea of de
blay was orichinally sdolen,” said Gormleigh, who had
blossomed out in new clothes, a red necktie, and a cat’s-eye
pin.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Leading idea of the play is the Ozone,” said De
Hanna; “and as Slump’s firm holds the patent for the
electro-oxygen generator, and manufactures the oxygen
used in the theater——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dey call it bure oxygen, poot it is not dat,” said
Gormleigh, laying his finger to his nose. “It is a motch
cheaber gombound, I give you my vort.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What?” De Hanna came closer, and his Oriental
eyes gleamed. “If that’s true, and we could manufacture
and generate it for ourselves, we—we could buy up
every rotten play we come across—there’s heaps of them
to be had, Heaven knows—and run ’em for nuts. What
is the stuff?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is nitrous oxide,” said Gormleigh, “gommonly
known as loffing kass—and I hof a friend, a Chairman
chemist—dat vill——Hoosh!” He laid his finger to
his nose with an air of secrecy as Mrs. Gudrun swept into
the office, enveloped in her usual clouds of silk and perfume.
Candelish was not with her, but Slump and Billy
followed at her heels.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course, it must be admitted, <cite>Maggs</cite> is a phenomenal
success,” she was saying, “and we’re making money
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>hand over hand; but the part of ‘Angelina’—though
Cluffer says no French comedy actress of any age or period
could act it as I do—does not give me proper opportunities.
Mr. Slump thinks with me.” She smiled
dazzlingly upon the enamored little man. “And he has
written a tragedy in blank verse—<cite>The Poisoned Smile</cite>—which
we mean to produce as soon as the run is over.”
She swept out again with her following, and De Hanna
and Gormleigh exchanged a wink of partnership.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A tragedy in blank verse by Slump.... Phew!”
De Hanna whistled. “They won’t want laughing-gas
for that.... As for us, we go snacks in biz. I’ll find
the Syndicate and the theater.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oond I de blays, de sdage-management, oond de kass.
De Chairman chemist friend I dold you of, I hof vith
him already a gontract made.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps it is a bit shady,” said De Hanna punctiliously,
“to exploit an idea that really is Slump’s property....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“De chokes in Slump’s comic baber he sdole from a
Chairman orichinal,” said Gormleigh pachydermatously.
“It is nodding poot tid for tad!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I believe in the value of an ad.,” said Mrs. Gudrun
one night at the Paris Grand Opera, the Sceptre Theatre,
London, being temporarily closed pending a new production.
“Sarah believes in it, too—and that’s another of
the remarkable points of resemblance between us. And
for the sake of a puff, I’m willing to do all that a woman
can.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can’t do more,” said De Petoburgh, shaking his
head owlishly. “Can’t possibly do more.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Shut up, De Peto. That woman’s ready to bite you
for talking through her big <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">aria</span></i>,” commanded Mrs. Gudrun,
with a slight glance of imperial indifference towards
the infuriated <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">prima donna</span></i>. She dropped her opera-glasses
into the orchestra with a crash, narrowly shaving
the kettle-drums, and causing the cymbal-player to miss
his cue, as she continued: “But, though I’m generally
keen to see the pay-end of a big notion, this idea of
Bobby Bolsover’s won’t do for macaroons. Not that I’m
lacking in what the Americans call horse-grit—wasn’t I
on De Brin’s automobile when he won the Paris-Rouen
race with his Gohard Cup Defender in nineteen-three?
That was one hairbreadth escape, from the revolver shot
that started us—you remember Bobby put in ball cartridge
by mistake—to the three flying kilometers at the
finish, which we did on one wheel, as the brakes refused
to act. And I’ve hung by one coupling over a raging
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>American river in my own drawing-room Pullman saloon.
But when it comes to dangling in a little basket
that weighs next to nothing from a bag of gas that
weighs nothing at all—I’m not taking any, and I don’t
care who knows it. A captive balloon’s another thing.
You’re cabled and sand-bagged and what not, and, unless
you jump out, nothing can happen to you. But——Do
see who’s knocking at the door!”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a uniformed and epauletted functionary conveying
the polite intimation of the management that
Madame and her party must positively maintain silence
during the performance, or make themselves the trouble
to depart!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell him we’d had enough and were just going!”
commanded Mrs. Gudrun. She rose, and, followed by
the Duke, Bobby Bolsover, and Teddy Candelish—most
active and ubiquitous of business managers, sailed out
of the box, knocking over a fauteuil and carrying a footstool
away upon the surging billows of her train. “Calls
herself an artist!” she said, in reference to the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">prima
donna</span></i>, upon whose trills and roulades an enraptured
audience hung breathless and enthralled; “and lets herself
be put about by a little thing like that! Where’s
her artistic absorption, I should like to know. Why, I’ve
studied Juliet in the drawing-room where Bobby and
De Petoburgh were having a rat-hunt under the tables
and things, and what difference did it make to my conception
of the part? Not a sou. And <em>she</em> was a shrimp-seller
at Nice! They all have that <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">voce squillante</span></i> and
those thick flat ankles and those rolling black eyes like
treacle-balls. Let’s go and have some supper at the
Café Paris.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Over American grilled lobster and quails <em>Georges
Sand</em>, Bobby Bolsover’s grand notion for an advertisement,
cropped up again. One may explain that it consisted
in the suggestion that Mrs. Gudrun and party
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>should electrify Paris, and subsequently London, by
traveling <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per</span></i> motor-airship from St. Cloud, rounding
the Eiffel Tower in emulation of the immortal Santos,
and returning to the Highfliers’ Club airship station at
the Parc upon the conclusion of the feat. A friend of
De Petoburgh’s, a distinguished member of the Highfliers’
Club, would undertake to lend the airship—a
newly completed vessel, with basket accommodation for
three. This philanthropist did not propose to share the
notoriety by joining the trip, and it was to be distinctly
understood that De Petoburgh was to be responsible for
any expenses involved.</p>

<p class='c009'>And Bobby Bolsover, brimming, as usual, with genuine
British bravery and brandy-and-soda, was ready to
assume command.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You know the principle of a motor?” Bobby demanded,
as the supper proceeded, and a collection of
champagne corks, gradually amassed on the corner of
the table, assumed proportions favorable to purposes of
demonstration.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Candelish knows the principle of a motor,” said De
Petoburgh. “Never could learn myshelf. Too much
borror!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“One may say that there is gasoline in a receptacle,”
began Teddy. “Air passing through becomes charged
with gas, and comes out ready to explode. Then——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To explode,” agreed De Petoburgh; “absorutely correc’
dennifishion, by Ringo!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t mind De Peto: he’s in for one of his old attacks,”
said Mrs. Gudrun. “His legs have been all over
the place since breakfast. Well?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You give a twirl to a crank,” said Bobby Bolsover.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Down goes the piston,” continued Teddy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Down go her pistol,” nodded De Petoburgh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And the dashed thing begins working automatically,”
exclaimed Bobby Bolsover. De Petoburgh balked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>at the six-syllabled hedge. “Now, an airship is an example
of——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The effectiveness of an aërial propeller driven by a
petrol motor,” put in Teddy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Jusso,” said De Petoburgh. “Jusso.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is, practically speaking, no danger whatever,”
pursued Bobby Bolsover, warming to the subject, “that
does not attend other popular pursuits. You may be
thrown from a horse, or tumble off a coach-box——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did once,” said De Petoburgh, smiling in sad retrospection.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Or you may blow up in a motor,” went on Bobby.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But in either case,” said Mrs. Gudrun, with point,
“one is on the ground, not hanging between heaven and
earth, like What’s-his-name’s coffin.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Brarro!” exclaimed De Petoburgh. “Encore!
<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Bis!</span></i>”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Permit me to put in, dear lady,” said Teddy Candelish,
with his best professional manner, “that if you fall
out of an airship, you eventually finish on the ground!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Under,” gloomily interpolated De Petoburgh. “Under.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And, further,” said Bobby Bolsover, “the guide-rope
is in connection with the ground all the time. Seventy
feet of it, trailing like——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Snakes!” said the irrepressible De Petoburgh, with
a glassy stare.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And,” went on Bobby, “we will have four picked
men from the Highfliers’ Club Grounds to run beside the
guide-rope all the way and back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thus combining personal advertisement,” said Teddy
Candelish, “with physical integrity.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Gudrun permitted her classical features to
soften. “Now you’re talking!” the lady said. She
smiled through the bottom of her champagne-glass as
Teddy, bowed in acknowledgment of the compliment, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>the trip was arranged forthwith. Thanks to the discretion
of Teddy Candelish, the preparations were kept so
profoundly secret that all Paris was on the alert when
the eventful morning dawned. The Highfliers’ Club
Grounds were literally besieged, and the intending sky-navigators
fought their way to the aërodrome containing
their vessel through a surging throng of scientists, editors,
journalists, dandies, actresses, photographers, pickpockets,
and politicians.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Regular scrimmage—what?” panted Bobby Bolsover,
as, bare-headed and disheveled, he reached the private
side-door of the balloon-house.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We ought to have slept here,” said Mrs. Gudrun,
straightening her hat-brim as the breathless men collected
her hairpins.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing but perches to sleep on,” objected Bobby
Bolsover, indicating the skeleton arrangements of the
vast interior.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Gudrun, whose eye soared with Bobby’s, would
have changed color had the feat been possible.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do we really climb up that awful ladder to get on
board?” she inquired. “I have more nerve than any
woman I know; but I wasn’t educated as an acrobat.
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">J’en suis tout baba</span></i>, Bobby, that you should have let us
all in for a thing like this. We’re planted, however, and
must go through. What crowds of smart women! What
on earth has brought <em>them</em> out so early in the morning?
It must have got about that I’m going to be killed!”
She gulped and clutched Teddy. “I c-can’t go on in this
scene! Make an apology—make an apology and say
I’m ill. I <em>am</em> ill—horribly!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I feel far from frisky,” said Bobby Bolsover candidly.
“Gout all last night in the head and eyes, and—every
limb, in fact, that one relies upon in steering a motor.
But, of course, I am ready to undertake the helm—unless
anybody else would like to volunteer?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>He looked at Teddy, whose eye was clear, whose cheek
was blooming, whose golden curls encroached upon a
forehead unlined with the furrows of personal apprehension.</p>

<p class='c009'>“W-what do you say, Teddy?” gasped Mrs. Gudrun.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I deeply regret.... It is imperatively necessary,
dear lady,” said Teddy glibly, “that in your absolute
interests I should be at the ‘Fritz’ at twelve. The Paris
representatives of the <cite>Daily Yelper</cite>, the <cite>Morning
Whooper</cite>, and the <cite>Greenroom Rag</cite>, have appointed that
hour to receive particulars of your start; three Berlin
correspondents, one from Nice, and the editors of the
<cite>Journal Rigolo</cite> and the <cite>Vie Patachon</cite> are to hole in ten
minutes later; and there will be thousands of telegrams
to open and answer. You know that the Syndicate of
the Escurial Palace of Varieties have actually tendered
to secure the turn. Therefore, though my heart will
make the voyage in your company, I—cannot.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Blue-eyed Teddy melted into thin air. Mrs. Gudrun,
looking older than a professional beauty has any right
to look, surveyed her companions with a hollow gaze of
despair, while outside the aërodrome Paris roared and
waited. Bobby, as green as jade, in a complete suit of
motor armor, goggles included, leaned limply against the
ladder that led upwards to the platform of the aërodrome.
De Petoburgh, in foul-weather yachting kit, his
glass fixed in his bloodshot left eye by the little mechanical
contrivance that keeps it from tumbling, looked back.
That debilitated nobleman, though shaky, was game to
the backbone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t drive a motor, Bolsover,” he said quite distinctly,
“but I can drive <em>you</em>. Will you—oblige me—by
climbing up that ladder? We follow. After you,
dear lady!”</p>

<p class='c009'>And the three negotiated the giddy ascent. Upon the
platform they found the owner of the airship and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>four workmen who, under promise of reward and threat
of punishment, were to attend the guide-rope. The airship
itself, a vast sausage-shaped silk bag of hydrogen,
from which depended by rubber-sheathed piano wires a
framework of proven bamboo supporting three baskets—one
forward, one amidships, and one aft—hovered
over the heads of the three depressed adventurers like
a shapeless embodiment of adverse Fate. And Paris
was growing impatient.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell ’em to stick to the guide-rope, De Croqueville,
for their lives,” urged Bobby feverishly, squeezing the
hands of the owner of the machine. “Give it ’em in
their own lingo; my French isn’t fluent to-day. They’re
not to trust to my steering, but just tow us to the Tower
and back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>De Croqueville squeezed back, and embraced Bobby on
both cheeks. “My brave, my very dear, rely upon me.
Madame”—he kissed the jeweled knuckles of Mrs. Gudrun—“all
Paris is assembled to behold the most beautiful
woman prove herself also to be of the most brave.
M. le Duc,” he saluted De Petoburgh distantly, and then
cordially shook hands, “I am as kin a sportsman as how
you. I have plank my egg—my oof—a thousand francs
you circulate the Tour Eiffel, in spite of the wind, which
blows from the wrong quarter. Adieu!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Blows from the wrong quarter!” gasped Bobby Bolsover.
The eyeglass of De Petoburgh turned in his direction,
and he immediately climbed the forward ladder
and got into the steersman’s creaking basket, and grasped
the wheel with an awful sinking immediately below the
heart.... The Duke helped Mrs. Gudrun to assume
the central position, and got in astern. Just before the
starting word was given and the great doors of the aërodrome
rolled apart in their steel grooves, he leaned over
to De Croqueville, addressing that gentleman in his own
language:</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>“One supposes she”—he alluded to the vessel—“is—sea—I
mean air-worthy—eh, my friend?”</p>

<p class='c009'>De Croqueville shot up his eyebrows and spread his
hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>“One supposes.... Truly, dear friend, I know
not!... The vessel is newly complete—this is what
in English you call the try-trip. That is why I hedge
my bet. One thousand francs you round the Tour Eiffel
and return uninjure—two thousand you do not return
uninjure—whether you round the Tour or no. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Adieu-dieu!</span></i>”</p>

<p class='c009'>The electric signal rang. The colossal doors groaned
apart. The four workmen scuttled down the ladders
like frightened mice, seized the guide-rope, and towed
the airship out of dock. Paris waved handkerchiefs,
cheered. Bobby Bolsover, ghastly behind his goggles,
pressed the pedal and manipulated the wheel. The engine
throbbed, the tail-shaft screw revolved. The adventurers
had started.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Qui-quite nice,” gulped Mrs. Gudrun tremulously,
as the keen wind toyed with her silk veil and fluttered
her fur boa.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She pitches,” said De Petoburgh briefly. “Keep her
head to it, Bolsover.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a sickening moment as the airship mounted
obliquely upward.... Then a tug at the guide-rope
brought her nose down, pointing to the sea of fluttering
handkerchiefs beneath. Mrs. Gudrun groaned and clung
to the sides of her padded basket. De Petoburgh
swore.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t—manage her. My—my nerve has gone.
Let’s put about and take her back to dock again,”
gasped Bobby.</p>

<p class='c009'>“For—for Heaven’s sake, do!” groaned Mrs. Gudrun.
But again that new voice spake from the blue lips of De
Petoburgh, and——</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>“I’ve lived like a dashed blackguard, but I’m not going
to die like a cowardly cad. Curtain’s up—go through
with the show. Bolsover, you bragging, white-livered
idiot, you can steer an electric launch and drive a motor-car.
If I’d ever learned to do either, I’d take your
place. But as I can’t—go ahead, and keep on as I direct,
or I’ll shoot you through your empty skull with this revolver”—the
click of the weapon came stimulatingly to
the ears of the scared helmsman—“and swear I went
mad and wasn’t responsible. They—they’d believe me!
Mabel, if you sit tight and go through with this, I’ll
stand you that thousand-guinea tiara you liked at Alphonse’s,
if we—when we get safe to ground. Now,
Bolsover, drive on, or take the consequences!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Perhaps the familiar terms employed restored Bobby
to the use of his suspended faculties. Certain it is that
the airship began to forge steadily ahead at the rate of
some twenty miles an hour—but <em>not</em> absolutely in the
direction of the vast spidery erection of metal which
was its destined goal. It skimmed in the direction of
the Bois de Boulogne, keeping at so lofty an altitude that
of the end of the guide-rope merely a length of some
six feet trailed upon the ground.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Those—those men l-look so funny running after it,”
said Mrs. Gudrun, upon whom the promise of the tiara
had acted as a stimulant.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope they may keep up with it,” muttered De
Petoburgh as the airship sailed over the humming streets
of the gay city, and tiny men and women turned white
specks of faces upwards to stare. “Ease her, Bolsover,”
he commanded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, we’re going right up again!” gasped Mrs. Gudrun.
Then, as the airship regained the horizontal:
“This isn’t half bad,” she said in a more cheerful tone,
“but the housetops with their spiky chimney-pots look
dreadfully dangerous. The guide-rope has knocked a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>row of potted geraniums off a third-floor balcony, and
the old man who was reading the paper in the cane
chair must be swearing awfully. But where are the
men? I don’t see them; do you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The four workmen were at that moment heatedly
cursing the Municipal Council of Paris at the bottom of
a very long, very deep trench which had been excavated
across a certain street for the accommodation of a new
drain. The guide-rope pursued its course without them,
now sweeping a peaceful citizen off his legs, now covering
the occupants of a smart victoria with mud, now
trailing over a roof or coiling serpent-wise around the
base of a block of chimneys. In the distance loomed the
Eiffel Tower, but in answer to De Petoburgh’s repeated
requests that he should steer thither, Bobby Bolsover
only groaned. And the airship, after navigating gracefully
over the green ocean of the Bois de Boulogne,
continued her trip over the Longchamps racecourse,
veered to the south at the pleasure of a shifting current
of air, and, having leaked much, began plainly to buckle
and bend.</p>

<p class='c009'>De Petoburgh, uncomfortably conscious of a misspent
existence and wasted opportunities, looked at the back
of Mrs. Gudrun’s head, and wondered whether she knew
any prayers.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The trees are coming awfully close, aren’t they?”
said the unconscious beauty.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Awfully!” said the Duke, as the capricious motor
stopped.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Mrs. Gudrun screamed, and Bobby Bolsover,
casting his goggles to the winds, huddled in the bottom
of his basket, and the debilitated but plucky nobleman
shut his eyes and thought of his long-dead mother as the
airship hurtled downwards ... crash into the top of the
tallest of the giant oaks in the magnificent park of
H.S.H. Prince Gogonof Babouine.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>The Prince has the reputation of being excessively
hospitable. When the three passengers recovered from
the shaking, the top of a long ladder pierced the thick
foliage beneath the wrecked vessel, and the Prince’s
major-domo, a stout personage in black with a gold
chain, came climbing up with a courteous message from
the Prince. Would Madame and M. le Duc and the other
gentleman descend and partake of the second <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">déjeuner</span></i>,
which was on the point of being served, or would they
prefer to remain on board their vessel?</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stop up here? Does the man take us for angels?”
snorted Mrs. Gudrun indignantly.</p>

<p class='c009'>The descent was not without danger, but with the aid
of De Petoburgh and the major-domo, she braved and
completed it without injury either to her long celebrated
limbs or her famous features. Bobby followed.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Prince entertained the shipwrecked castaways in
princely fashion, and drove the party back to Paris on
his drag, the wonderful yellow coach with the team of
curly Orloffs. And he consented to dine; and that night
Mrs. Gudrun held a reception behind the illuminated
balconies of the Hotel Fritz, while the London newsboys
were yelling her familiar name, and the evening papers
containing the most ornamental particulars of her adventure
went off like hot cakes.</p>

<p class='c009'>According to the most reliable account garnered by
our special correspondent from the lovely lips of the
exquisite aëronaut, she had never quailed in the moment
of peril, and, indeed, upon the distinguished authority
of the Hon. R. Bolsover: “One is never frightened
while one can rely upon one’s own pluck!” Nobody
interviewed De Petoburgh, leaning vacuously smiling
against the wall. Indeed, he had developed another of
his attacks, and could not have responded with any coherence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wonderful fellow, Bolsover,” Teddy Candelish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>gushed, Teddy, all smile and sparkle, “so brainy and resourceful!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Rath’ ...” assented De Petoburgh fragmentarily.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And Her Nibs—a heroine—positively a heroine!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ra’!” assented De Petoburgh, as the heroine swept
by, making magnificent eyes at the palpably enamored
Prince, while Paris murmured indiscreet admiration.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you, Duke, eh? Found it trying to your nerves,
they tell me?” Teddy continued, twirling his golden
mustache. “Such trips too costly, eh, to indulge in
often?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ra’!” agreed De Petoburgh, with a glance at the
thousand-guinea diamond fender surmounting the most
frequently photographed features in the world.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>SIDE!</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Upon the conclusion of the phenomenally brief run of
<cite>The Poisoned Kiss</cite> at the Sceptre Theatre, Mrs. Gudrun,
who had sustained the heroic rôle of Aldapora “with
abounding verve and true histrionic inwardness” (to
cull a quotation from the enthusiastic notice which appeared
in the <cite>Theatrical Piffer</cite>), and whose sculpturesque
temples throbbed no less with the weight of the
dramatic laurels heaped upon them than with the heady
quality of the champagne with which those laurels had
been liberally drowned—Mrs. Gudrun left the author
and the Syndicate, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per</span></i> their Business Representative,
exchanging poignant personalities over a non-existent
percentage, and hied her to the Gallic capital for recreation
and repose; bearing in her train the leading man,
Mr. Leo De Boo, a young actor who had chipped the egg
of obscurity in the recent production. De Boo was “a
splendid specimen of virile beauty,” according to the
<cite>Greenroom Rag</cite>—all shoulders, legs, nose, and curls,
without any perceptible forehead; and Teddy Candelish,
most ubiquitous of acting-managers, came within an appreciable
distance of being epigrammatic when he
termed him “a chronic cad in beautiful boots.” For
more exquisite foot-gloves than those De Boo sported
were never seen, whoever made and gave credit for
them; and De Boo was said to have a different pair for
every day in the month and every imaginable change in
the weather.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nearly threw up his part in <cite>The Poisoned Kiss</cite>,”
said Teddy afterwards, at the club, “when he discovered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>that it was to be a sixteenth-century production; took
me aside, and told me in confidence afterwards, that if
he’d been allowed to play Hermango in gray <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">suède</span> tops
with black pearl buttons and patent leather uppers, the
piece would have been a colossal monetary, as well as
artistic, success.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Schwerlich! Who konn bretend to follow de workings
of a mind like dot jung man’s,” said Oscar Gormleigh,
“vidout de assisdance of de migroscope? Und
hof I not known a brima donna degline to go on for

nachtigall. De choke of it vas”—the talented stage-director
laid a hairy finger archly against his Teutonic
nose—“dat voman always groak—not never varble—tights
or no tights!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“De Boo is a rank bounder,” said Candelish decidedly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He has pounded from de ranks,” pronounced Gormleigh,
“und he vill go on pounding—each pound so
motch higher dan de last von, oontil he drop splosh into

segond hond furnidure.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Gudrun would have been deeply incensed had
she heard this unlicensed expression of opinion from
one whom she had always kept in his place as a paid underling.
For six nights and a matinée she had, in the
character of Aldapora, elected to poison herself in the
most painful manner rather than incur the loss of De
Boo’s affections, and, with the “true histrionic inwardness”
so belauded by the <cite>Theatrical Piffer</cite>, she had identified
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>herself with the part. So she took a blazing comet
flight to Paris with the actor in her train, and paragraphs
announcing their arrival at the Hotel Spitz appeared
in the London papers.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Listen to this, Jane Ann,” said the paternal De Boo,
whose name was Boodie—and when I add that for twenty
years the worthy father had been employed as one
of the principal cutters at Toecaps and Heels, that celebrated
firm of West-End bootmakers, it will be understood
whence the son obtained his boots. “To think,”
Mr. Boodie continued, “that Alfred—our Alfred, who
sp’iled every particle of leather he set his knife to, and
couldn’t stitch a welt or strap a seam to save his life—should
ever have lived to be called a rising genius!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The ways of Providence are wonderful, father!” returned
the said Alfred’s mother dutifully. Mrs. Boodie
was an experienced finisher herself, and had always
lamented Alfred’s lack of “turn” in the family direction.
“An’, if I was you, I wouldn’t mention that bit
in the paper to Aphasia Cutts. She’s dreadful jealous
over our Alfred, even now, though he hasn’t bin to see
‘er or wrote for two years. As good as a break off, I
should a-regarded it, ’ad I bin in her place. But she’s
different to what I was.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So are all the gals,” said Mr. Boodie with conviction,
bestowing upon his wife a salute flavored with Russia
leather and calf.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I’m sure. Go along, father, do!” said Mrs.
Boodie, with a delighted shove.</p>

<p class='c009'>But of course Aphasia—so christened by an ambitious
mother in defiance of the expostulations of a timid
curate—had already seen and cried over the paragraph.
She had loved Alfred and stood up for him when he was
a plain, stupid boy with an unconquerable aversion to
work. She had been his champion when he grew up, no
longer plain, but as pronounced a loafer as ever. She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>had given up, in exchange for his loutish affections, the
love of an honest and hard-working man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t ’elp it!” she had said; “you can get on without
me, and Alfred can’t, pore chap. His Par calls ’im
a waster—I believe ’e’d give ’im the strap if ’e wasn’t
six foot ’igh. But I’ve got ’im an opening in the theatrical
line, through a friend of mine as does fancy braiding
at Buskin’s, the stage shoemaker’s in Covent Garden.
It’s only to walk on as one of the Giant’s boy-babies
in the Drury Lane panto.—eighteen pence a night
<em>and matinées</em>—but his Mar will be thankful. If only ’is
legs are long enough for the part——”</p>

<p class='c009'>They were, and from that hour Alfred had embarked
on a career. When entrusted with a line to speak, it
was Aphasia who held the grimy slip of paper on which
it was written and aided the would-be actor with counsel
and advice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And ’old up your ’ead, do, as if you was proud of
yourself, and don’t bend at the knees; and whether you
remember your words or not, throw ’em out from your
chest as if you was proud of ’em. An’ move your arms
from the shoulder like as if you was swimmin’—don’t
crook your elbers like a wooden doll. And throw a bit
o’ meanin’ into your eye. You took me to see that
Frenchman, Cocklin ’e calls ’imself; as played the chap
with the boko ’e wouldn’t let the other chaps make game
of.... French or Japanese, they’re both Dutch to
me, but I watched Cocklin’s eye, and I watched ’is ’ands,
an’ I could foller the story as if it was print, an’ plainer.
I’ve went to see an actor since what folks said was a
great artis’, and if ’e did talk English, ’is eye was as
dumb as a boiled fresh ’addock’s an’ ’s ’ands was like
slices of skate. Now say your bit over again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And Alfred said it, this time to the satisfaction of
his instructress. When he got a real part Aphasia
coached him, and rode down from Hammersmith with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>him on the bus, and was waiting for him at the stage-door
when he came out, the tears of joy undried on her
pale cheeks. And that was the night upon which she
first noticed a coldness in the manner of her betrothed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“An’ now I’m not good enough for him to wipe his
boots on,” she sobbed, sitting on her bed in the single
room lodging off the roaring, clanging Broadway—“the
boots ’is Par cut an’ welted, an’ ’is Mar stitched, an’ I
finished. But I won’t stand in ’is light. I’ve my pride,
if I am a boot-finisher. I’ll see that Mrs. What’s-her-name
face to face, an’ ’ave it out as woman to woman,
an’ tell ’er she’s welcome to marry ’im for me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And Aphasia dried her poor red eyes and took off
Alfred’s betrothal ring—a fifteen-carat gold circlet with
three real garnets, bought in the Broadway one blushful,
blissful Saturday night—and evicted his photographs
from their gorgeous cheap frames, and made a
brown-paper parcel of these things, with a yellow leather
purse with a blue enamel “A” on it, and tied it up with
string.</p>

<p class='c009'>Perhaps something of her fateful mood was telepathically
conveyed to Mr. Leo De Boo at that moment, for
he shivered as he sat at the feet of Mrs. Gudrun upon
the balcony of a private suite at the Hotel Spitz, and
turned up eyes that were large and lustrous at that imperishable
image of Beauty, exhaling clouds of fashionable
perfume and upborne on billows of chiffon and lace.
Mrs. Gudrun, who naturally mistook the spasms of a
genuine plebeian British conscience for the pangs of
love, lent him her hand—dazzlingly white, astonishingly
manicured, jeweled to the knuckles, and polished by the
devout kisses of generations of worshipers—and De Boo
mumbled it, and tried to be grateful and talk beautifully
about his acting. But this bored Mrs. Gudrun, who
preferred to talk about her own.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have often felt that myself,” she said—“the conviction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>that a crowded audience hung upon my lips and
saw only with my eyes, and that I swayed them as with
a magic thingumbob, by the power of a magnetic personality.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is a mystery,” said De Boo, passing his long fingers
through his clustering curls, “that once in a century
or so a man should be born——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Or a woman. Marvelous!” agreed Mrs. Gudrun.
“Marvelous! the man who runs the <cite>Daily Tomahawk</cite>
said that when I made my first appearance on the
stage.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Genius is a crown of fire,” said De Boo, who had
read this somewhere. “It illuminates the world, yet
scorches the wearer to the bone. He——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She suffers,” said Mrs. Gudrun, neatly stopping the
ball and playing it on her side. “You may bet she suffers.
Hasn’t she got the artistic temperament? The
amount of worry mine has given me you would never
believe. Cluffer, of the <cite>Morning Whooper</cite>, calls me a
‘consolidated bundle of screaming nerves.’ When I’ve
sat down to dinner on the eve of a first night, De Petoburgh—you’ve
met the Duke?—has had to hold me in
my chair while Bobby Bolsover gave me champagne and
Angostura out of the soup-ladle. And I believe I bit
a piece out of that. And afterwards—ask ’em both if I
wasn’t fairly <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esquinte</span></i>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But the possessor of an artistic temperament—such
as mine—even though the fairy gift entails the keenest
susceptibility to anguish,” quickly continued De Boo,
“enjoys unspeakable compensation in the revelation to
him alone of a kingdom which others may not enter.
Looking upon the high mountains in the blush of dawn,
I have shouted aloud with glee——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The first time I ever went into a southern Italian
orange-grove in full bloom,” acquiesced Mrs. Gudrun,
“the Prince of Kursaal Carle Monto, who was with me,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>simply sat down flat. He said Titian ought to have been
alive to paint my face and form against that background....
By the way, the first act of that new
play, the title of which I’ve forgotten, and which I’ve
leased from a scribbling idiot whose name don’t signify,
takes place in a blooming orange-grove. I’ve cast you
for the leading man’s part, Leo, and I hope you will
be properly grateful for the chance, and conquer that
nasty habit you have of standing leering at the audience
in all my great moments.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dearest lady,” De Boo argued glibly, “does it not
increase the dramatic poignancy of such moments if
the spectators are enabled to read in the varying expressions
pictured on <em>my</em> face the feelings your art inspires?”</p>

<p class='c009'>But Mrs. Gudrun was inexorable. “They can read
’em in the back of your head if they’re anxious,” said
she, “or they can take the direct tip from me. I hope
that’s good enough. I don’t see the cherry-bun of running
a theater to be scored off by other people, and so
you know! And now that’s settled, let us go and have
stuffed oysters and roast ices at Noel Peter’s, and see
Sarah afterwards in her new tragedy <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôle</span></i>. I’m the only
woman she’s really afraid of, you know, and I feel I’m
bound to romp in in front of her before long. She
says herself that acting like mine cannot be taught
in a conservatoire, and that I constitute a complete
school in myself. Have you ever seen me play Lady
Teazle?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Unhappily I have not. It is a loss,” said De Boo,
“a distinct loss. By the way, when I scored so tremendously
as Charles Surface at Mudderpool——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hell is full of men who have scored as Charles
Surface at Mudderpool,” said Mrs. Gudrun crushingly.
“That sounds like a quotation, doesn’t it? Only it must
be mine, because I never read. You’re a charming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>fellow, and a clever boy, Leo, but, as a friend, let me
tell you that you talk too much about yourself. It’s
bad form; and the truly great are invariably the truly
modest. I must save up that epigram for my next interview,
I think. There’s the auto-brougham.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And De Boo enfolded the renowned form of his
manageress in a point lace and sable wrap, and they
went off to Noel Peter’s, and saw La Gr-r-ande perform.</p>

<p class='c014'>Rehearsals of the new play, <cite>Pride of Race</cite>, at the
Sceptre had scarcely commenced when in upon Teddy
Candelish, laboriously smoking in his sanctum and opening
the morning’s mail, swept Mrs. Gudrun.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I haven’t a moment to breathe,” she said imperially,
accepting the chair Teddy acrobatically vacated.
“Come in, De Petoburgh—come in, Bobby; you are in
the way, but I’m used to it. No, De Petoburgh, that
cellaret’s tabooed; remember what Sir Henry said to
you about liqueurs before lunch. Are there any letters
of importance, Teddy, to my cheek?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Several bundles of press-cuttings from different
firms, thirty or forty bills, a few tenders from photographers,
and—and some love-letters,” replied Candelish,
pointing to some neat piles of correspondence arranged
on the American roll-top desk. “Usual thing—declarations,
proposals, and so forth.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Always plenty of those—hey?” chuckled De Petoburgh,
sucking a perfunctory peptoid lozenge in lieu
of the stimulant denied.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Plenty, b’Jove!” echoed Bobby Bolsover.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not so many as there used to be,” responded Candelish
with tactless truthfulness, rewarded by the lady
with a magnificent glare. “By the way, there’s one
odd letter, from a girl or a woman who <em>isn’t</em> quite a
lady, asking for an interview on private business. Signs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>herself by the rummiest name—Aphasia Cutts.” He
presented the letter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Aphasia?” said Mrs. Gudrun, extending heavily jeweled
fingers for the missive. “Isn’t that what De Petoburgh
has when he can only order drinks in one syllable
and his legs take him where he doesn’t want to
go? Eh, Bobby?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; but remindin’ the Duke of that always brings
on an attack,” said Bobby solicitously. “Look at him
twitchin’ now.... Steady, Peto! Woa-a, old mannums!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Take him for a tatta while I finish the rehearsal,”
commanded Mrs. Gudrun, rising from Teddy’s chair in
an upsurge of expensive draperies. “Write to this
Aphasia girl, Teddy, and say I’ll see her to-morrow,
between three and four p. m. After all, the whole-souled
adoration of one’s own sex is worth having,” the
lady said, as, heralded by the rustling of silken robes,
the barbaric clash of jeweled ornaments, and wafts of
fashionable perfume, she sailed back to the boards.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Aphasia got her reply, p.p. Teddy, some hours
later, there was very little of whole-souled adoration
in her reception of the missive.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I s’pose she looks on me as the dirt under her feet,
like Alfred. But I won’t let that put me off makin’
the sacrifice that’s for his good—the ungrateful thing!
I ’ope she’ll make ’im a nice wife, that’s all,” she
sobbed, as she took from her collar-and-cuff drawer the
flat brown-paper parcel containing the garnet ring, the
photographs, and the letters. And she dressed herself
in her best, with a large lace collar over a cloth jacket,
and the once fashionable low-necked pneumonia-blouse,
to which the girls of her class so fondly cling, and went
to meet the lady whom, in terms borrowed from the
latest penny romance, she called her “haughty rival.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Gudrun received her with excessive graciousness.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>A costume rehearsal was in progress, and the lady was
in the hands of her maids and dressers. “I suppose
this is the first time you have ever been behind the
scenes?” she inquired. “Look about you as much as
you like, and then you will be able to say to your
friends: ‘I have been in Mrs. Gudrun’s dressing-room.’
You see, I am in the gown I wear in the first act. It
is by Babin; and if you write for a ladies’ paper, you
will remember to say so, please.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t write for any ladies’ paper,” said Aphasia.
“I couldn’t spell well enough—not if they ast me ever
so. But it’s a lovely gownd, and I suppose all that
stuff on your face is what makes you look so young an’
’andsome—from a long way off.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Gudrun’s famous features assumed a look of
cold displeasure. She assumed the majestic air that
suited her so eminently well, and asked the young person’s
business.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s quite private, and I’ll thank you to send away
your maids, if you’ve no objection,” said the dauntless
Aphasia. “The fact is,” she continued, when the indignant
menials had been waved from the apartment,
“as I’ve come to make you a present—a present of a
young man——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look here, my good young woman,” began the incensed
manageress.</p>

<p class='c009'>Aphasia suddenly handed her the brown-paper parcel,
and the wrath of Mrs. Gudrun was turned to
trembling. She was sure this was an escaped lunatic.
Aphasia profited by the lull in the storm to explain.
She had come to hand over her Alfred—stock, goodwill,
and fixtures. He had forgotten to be off with the old
love before he went on with the new, but the old love
bore no malice. All was now over.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you may marry ’im whenever you like,”
sobbed Aphasia.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>“I never heard anything so indecent in the whole
course of my life,” said Mrs. Gudrun, rising in offended
majesty. “Marry Mr. De Boo, indeed! If I had married
every leading man I’ve played love-scenes with
since I adopted this profession, I should be a female
Brigham Young! ‘In love with me!’ Perhaps he is;
it’s rather a common complaint among the men I know.
As for Mr. De Boo, if he has low connections and vulgar
entanglements, they are nothing to me. Good-day!
Stop! You had better take this parcel of rubbish with
you. Dawkins—the stage-door!”</p>

<p class='c009'>And Aphasia found herself being ushered along the
passage. Bewildered and dazzled by the glaring lights,
the excitement and the strangeness, she ran almost into
the arms of De Boo himself as he emerged from his
dressing-room next the manageress’s. Had he overheard?
There had been a curtained-over door on that
side. Under his paint his handsome features were
black with rage; he caught the girl’s shoulders in a
furious grip, and spluttered in her ear:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Damn you! Damn you, you sneaking creature! You
have made a pretty mess of things for me—haven’t you?—with
your blab about my father and the boot-business,
and my letters and the ring I gave you. To my dying
day I’ll never speak to you again!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He threw her from him savagely and strode away.</p>

<p class='c009'>Aphasia stood outside the theater and shook with sobs.
It chanced—or did not chance, so queer are the vagaries
of Destiny—that Ulick Snowle, the president of the
New Stage-Door Club, happened to be passing; he had
just called in at the box-office to privately book the
first three rows of the upper circle on behalf of the
club, the Old Stage-Doorers having secured the gallery.
Both clubs were originally one, the Old Stage-Doorers
having thrown off the younger club as the cuttlefish gets
rid of the supernumerary limb which in time becomes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>another cuttlefish. And the unwritten compact between
both clubs is that if one applauds a new production,
the other shall execrate the same—an arrangement which
contributes hugely to the liveliness of first-nights.</p>

<p class='c009'>No uninitiated person beholding Ulick, with his shaggy
beard, aged felt-basin hat of Continental make, short
nautical coat, and tight-fitting sporting trousers, would
suppose him to be the great personage he really is. He
came up to Aphasia, and bluntly asked her what was
the matter, and if he couldn’t do something? In her
overwhelming woe and desolation, she was like the soda-water
bottle of the glass-ball-stoppered description—once
push in the stopper, there is no arresting the escape
of the aërated fluid. She told the sympathizing Ulick
all before he put her into the Hammersmith bus, and
when he would have handed in the fateful brown-paper
parcel—“Keep it,” she said, with a gesture of aversion.
“Burn it—chuck the thing in the dustbin. They’re no
manner o’ use to me!” And away she rattled, leaving
Ulick Snowle upon the pavement, in his hands an engine
of destruction meet to be used in the extermination of
the unfittest.</p>

<p class='c009'>For the New Stage-Door Club did not love Mr. Leo
De Boo, whose manner to old friends—whom he had
often led around street corners and relieved of half-crowns—did
not improve with his worldly prospects.
And Ulick stood and meditated while the double torrent
of the London traffic went roaring east and west; and
as a charitable old lady was about to press a penny into
his hand, Tom Glauber, the dandy president of the Old
Stage-Doorers, came along, and the men greeted cordially.
Von Glauber seemed interested in something
that Ulick had to tell, and the two went off very confidentially,
arm-in-arm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It would be a sensation if, for once, the O.S.D.’s and
the N.S.D.’s acted in unison,” agreed Tom Glauber.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>And on the night when <cite>Pride of Race</cite> was produced
at the Sceptre, both clubs attended in full strength, every
man with a crook-handled walking-stick, and a parcel
buttoned under his coat. The piece had just concluded
a run of three hundred nights, and every reader is acquainted
with the plot, which is of modern Italy and
Rome of to-day, to quote the programme. We all know
how the young Marchese di Monte Polverino, in whose
veins ran the bluest blood of the Latin race, secretly
wedded Aquella Guazetta, the tripe-seller, who had won
his lofty affections in the guise of a Bulgarian Princess,
and how the dread secret of Aquella’s origin was revealed
at the very moment when the loftiest and most
exclusive of the Roman nobility were about to welcome
the newly made Marchesa into their ranks.... Aquella,
her brain turned by the acuteness of her mental suffering,
greets the revelation with a peal of frenzied laughter.
Now this laughter was a continual obstacle, during
rehearsals, in the path of Mrs. Gudrun. Said she:</p>

<p class='c009'>“The peculiarity and originality of my genius, as
Cluffer says, consists in the fact that I can’t do the
things that might be expected of me—not for filberts;
while I <em>can</em> do the things that mightn’t. If I can’t really
hit off that laugh, I’ll have a woman in the wings to
do it for me. But my impression is that I shall be all
right at night. Don’t forget, Gormleigh, that you’re not
to tub the chandelier altogether; I hate to play to a
dark house.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Py vich innovation,” said Gormleigh afterwards,
“de gonsbirators vas enapled to garry out their blan.
Himmel!” he cried, dabbing his overflowing eyes with
an antediluvian silk pocket-handkerchief, “shall I effer
forget—no, not vile I lif—de face of dot jung man!”</p>

<p class='c009'>For at the moment when Monte Polverino’s scorn of
the lovely plebeian he has wedded is expressed in words—when
Aquella, pierced to the heart by being called
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>“a low-born vulgarian” and a “peasant huckster,” is
about to utter her famous yell of frenzied laughter, the
Old Stage-Doorers and the New Stage-Doorers hung out
their boots. A <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chevaux de frise</span></i> of walking-sticks, from
each of which depended a pair of these indispensable
articles of attire, graced the gallery, distinguished the
upper circle, and appeared upon the level of the pit.
Stricken to the soul, faltering and ghastly under his
paint, and shaking in the most sumptuous pair of patent
leathers, white kid topped, in which he had yet appeared,
De Boo blankly contemplated the horrid spectacle;
while Mrs. Gudrun, to whose somewhat latent
sense of humor the spectacle appealed, burst into peal
upon peal of the wildest laughter ever heard beyond
the walls of an establishment for the care of the mentally
afflicted. “The grandeur, poignancy, and reality
of the acting,” wrote Cluffer, of the <cite>Morning Whooper</cite>,
“was acknowledged by a crowded house with a deafening
and unanimous outburst of applause.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Both Mrs. Gudrun and Mr. De Boo attained the
highest level of dramatic expression,” pronounced Mullekens,
of the <cite>Daily Tomahawk</cite>. “It was the touch of
Nature which attunes the universe to one throb of universal
relationship.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The play was a success. Even the “Boo’s!” of both
the clubs, united for the nonce in disapprobation, could
not rob Leo of his laurels. He wears them to-day, for
<cite>Pride of Race</cite> has enjoyed a tremendous run.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ve made the beggar’s reputation instead of sending
him back to the boot-shop and that poor girl,” said
Ulick Snowle to Tom Glauber next day.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Possibly,” said Tom Glauber, sniffing at his inseparable
carnation. “But it’s all the better for the girl,
I imagine, in the long run.”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>A SPIRIT ELOPEMENT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>When I exchanged my maiden name for better or
worse, and dearest Vavasour and I, at the conclusion of
the speeches—I was married in a traveling-dress of
Bluefern’s—descended the steps of mamma’s house in
Ebury Street—the Belgravian, <em>not</em> the Pimlican end—and,
amid a hurricane of farewells and a hailstorm of
pink and yellow and white <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">confetti</span></i>, stepped into the
brougham that was to convey us to a Waterloo Station,
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</span></i> for Southampton—our honeymoon was to be
spent in Guernsey—we were perfectly well satisfied with
ourselves and each other. This state of mind is not
uncommon at the outset of wedded life. You may have
heard the horrid story of the newly-wedded cannibal
chief, who remarked that he had never yet known a
young bride to disagree with her husband in the early
stages of the honeymoon. I believe if dearest Vavasour
had seriously proposed to chop me into <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cotêlettes</span></i> and
eat me, with or without sauce, I should have taken it
for granted that the powers that be had destined me to
the high end of supplying one of the noblest of created
beings with an <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entrée</span></i> dish.</p>

<p class='c009'>We were idiotically blissful for two or three days. It
was flowery April, and Guernsey was looking her loveliest.
No horrid hotel or boarding-house sheltered our
lawful endearments. Some old friends of papa’s had
lent us an ancient mansion standing in a wild garden,
now one pink riot of almond-blossom, screened behind
lofty walls of lichened red brick and weather-worn,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>wrought-iron gates, painted yellow-white like all the
other iron and wood work about the house.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mon Désir” the place was called, and the fragrance
of potpourri yet hung about the old paneled salons.
Vavasour wrote a sonnet—I have omitted to speak before
of my husband’s poetic gifts—all about the breath
of new Passion stirring the fragrant dust of dead old
Love, and the kisses of lips long moldered that mingled
with ours. It was a lovely sonnet, but crawly, as the
poetical compositions of the Modern School are apt to
be. And Vavasour was an enthusiastic convert to, and
follower of, the Modern School. He had often told me
that, had not his father heartlessly thrown him into his
brewery business at the outset of his career—Sim’s Mild
and Bitter Ales being the foundation upon which the
family fortunes were originally reared—he, Vavasour,
would have been, ere the time of speaking, known to
Fame, not only as a Minor Poet, but a Minor Decadent
Poet—which trisyllabic addition, I believe, makes as advantageous
a difference as the word “native” when attached
to an oyster, or the guarantee “new laid” when
employed with reference to an egg.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dear Vavasour’s temperament and tastes having a
decided bias towards the gloomy and mystic, he had, before
his great discovery of his latent poetical gifts, and
in the intervals of freedom from the brain-carking and
soul-stultifying cares of business, made several excursions
into the regions of the Unknown. He had had
some sort of intercourse with the Swedenborgians, and
had mingled with the Muggletonians; he had coquetted
with the Christian Scientists, and had been, until Theosophic
Buddhism opened a wider field to his researches,
an enthusiastic Spiritualist. But our engagement somewhat
cooled his passion for psychic research, and when
questioned by me with regard to table-rappings, manifestations,
and materializations, I could not but be conscious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>of a reticence in his manner of responding to my
innocent desire for information. The reflection that he
probably, like Canning’s knife-grinder, had no story to
tell, soon induced me to abandon the subject. I myself
am somewhat reserved at this day in my method of dealing
with the subject of spooks. But my silence does
not proceed from ignorance.</p>

<p class='c009'>Knowledge came to me after this fashion. Though
the April sun shone bright and warm upon Guernsey,
the island nights were chill. Waking by dear Vavasour’s
side—the novelty of this experience has since been
blunted by the usage of years—somewhere between one
and two o’clock towards break of the fourth day following
our marriage, it occurred to me that a faint cold
draft, with a suggestion of dampness about it, was blowing
against my right cheek. One of the windows upon
that side—our room possessed a rather unbecoming cross-light—had
probably been left open. Dear Vavasour,
who occupied the right side of our couch, would wake
with toothache in the morning, or, perhaps, with mumps!
Shuddering, as much at the latter idea as with cold, I
opened my eyes, and sat up in bed with a definite intention
of getting out of it and shutting the offending casement.
Then I saw Katie for the first time.</p>

<p class='c009'>She was sitting on the right side of the bed, close to
dear Vavasour’s pillow; in fact, almost hanging over it.
From the first moment I knew that which I looked upon
to be no creature of flesh and blood, but the mere apparition
of a woman. It was not only that her face, which
struck me as both pert and plain; her hands; her hair,
which she wore dressed in an old-fashioned ringletty
mode—in fact, her whole personality was faintly luminous,
and surrounded by a halo of bluish phosphorescent
light. It was not only that she was transparent, so
that I saw the pattern of the old-fashioned, striped,
dimity bed-curtain, in the shelter of which she sat,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>quite plainly through her. The consciousness was further
conveyed to me by a voice—or the toneless, flat,
faded impression of a voice—speaking faintly and
clearly, not at my outer, but at my inner ear.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lie down again, and don’t fuss. It’s only Katie!”
she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Only Katie!” I liked that!</p>

<p class='c009'>“I dare say you don’t,” she said tartly, replying as
she had spoken, and I wondered that a ghost should
exhibit such want of breeding. “But you have got to
put up with me!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How dare you intrude here—and at such an hour!”
I exclaimed mentally, for there was no need to wake
dear Vavasour by talking aloud when my thoughts were
read at sight by the ghostly creature who sat so familiarly
beside him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I knew your husband before you did,” responded
Katie, with a faint phosphorescent sneer. “We became
acquainted at a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">séance</span></i> in North-West London soon after
his conversion to Spiritualism, and have seen a great
deal of each other from time to time.” She tossed her
shadowy curls with a possessive air that annoyed me
horribly. “He was constantly materializing me in order
to ask questions about Shakespeare. It is a standing
joke in our Spirit world that, from the best educated
spook in our society down to the most illiterate astral
that ever knocked out ‘rapport’ with one ‘p,’ we are
all expected to know whether Shakespeare wrote his
own plays, or whether they were done by another person
of the same name.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And which way was it?” I asked, yielding to a
momentary twinge of curiosity.</p>

<p class='c009'>Katie laughed mockingly. “There you go!” she said,
with silent contempt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish <em>you</em> would!” I snapped back mentally. “It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>seems to me that you manifest a great lack of refinement
in coming here!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I cannot go until Vavasour has finished,” said Katie
pertly. “Don’t you see that he has materialized me by
dreaming about me? And as there exists <em>at present</em>”—she
placed an annoying stress upon the last two words—“a
strong sympathy between you, so it comes about
that I, as your husband’s spiritual affinity, am visible
to your waking perceptions. All the rest of the time I
am hovering about you, though unseen.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I call it detestable!” I retorted indignantly. Then I
gripped my sleeping husband by the shoulder. “Wake
up! wake up!” I cried aloud, wrath lending power to
my grasp and a penetrative quality to my voice. “Wake
up and leave off dreaming! I cannot and will not endure
the presence of this creature another moment!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Whaa</em>——” muttered my husband, with the almost
inebriate incoherency of slumber, “<em>whasamaramydarling?</em>”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stop dreaming about that creature,” I cried, “or I
shall go home to Mamma!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Creature?” my husband echoed, and as he sat up I
had the satisfaction of seeing Katie’s misty, luminous
form fade slowly into nothingness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You know who I mean!” I sobbed. “Katie—your
spiritual affinity, as she calls herself!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You don’t mean,” shouted Vavasour, now thoroughly
roused, “that you have seen <em>her</em>?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do mean it,” I mourned. “Oh, if I had only
known of your having an entanglement with any creature
of the kind, I would never have married you—never!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hang her!” burst out Vavasour. Then he controlled
himself, and said soothingly: “After all, dearest,
there is nothing to be jealous of——”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>“I jealous! And of that——” I was beginning, but
Vavasour went on:</p>

<p class='c009'>“After all, she is only a disembodied astral entity
with whom I became acquainted—through my fifth principle,
which is usually well developed—in the days when
I moved in Spiritualistic society. She was, when living—for
she died long before I was born—a young lady
of very good family. I believe her father was a clergyman
... and I will not deny that I encouraged her
visits.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Discourage them from this day!” I said firmly.
“Neither think of her nor dream of her again, or I will
have a separation.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will keep her, as much as possible, out of my waking
thoughts,” said poor Vavasour, trying to soothe
me; “but a man cannot control his dreams, and she pervades
mine in a manner which, even before our engagement,
my pet, I began to find annoying. However, if she
really is, as she has told me, a lady by birth and breeding,
she will understand”—he raised his voice as though
she were there and he intended her to hear—“that I
am now a married man, and from this moment desire
to have no further communication with her. Any suitable
provision it is in my power to make——”</p>

<p class='c009'>He ceased, probably feeling the difficulty he would
have in explaining the matter to his lawyers; and it
seemed to me that a faint mocking sniggle, or rather
the auricular impression of it, echoed his words. Then,
after some more desultory conversation, we fell soundly
asleep. An hour may have passed when the same chilly
sensation as of a damp draft blowing across the bed
roused me. I rubbed my cheek and opened my eyes.
They met the pale, impertinent smile of the hateful
Katie, who was installed in her old post beside Vavasour’s
end of the bolster.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You see,” she said, in the same soundless way, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>with a knowing little nod of triumph, “it is no use. He
is dreaming of me again!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wake up!” I screamed, snatching the pillow from
under my husband’s head and madly hurling it at the
shameless intruder. This time Vavasour was almost
snappish at being disturbed. Daylight surprised us in
the middle of our first connubial quarrel. The following
night brought a repetition of the whole thing, and
so on, <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">da capo</span></i>, until it became plain to us, to our mutual
disgust, that the more Vavasour strove to banish Katie
from his dreams, the more persistently she cropped up
in them. She was the most ill-bred and obstinate of
astrals—Vavasour and I the most miserable of newly-married
people. A dozen times in a night I would be
roused by that cold draft upon my cheek, would open
my eyes and see that pale, phosphorescent, outline
perched by Vavasour’s pillow—nine times out of the
dozen would be driven to frenzy by the possessive air
and cynical smile of the spook. And although Vavasour’s
former regard for her was now converted into
hatred, he found the thought of her continually invading
his waking mind at the most unwelcome seasons.
She had begun to appear to both of us <em>by day as well as
by night</em> when our poisoned honeymoon came to an end,
and we returned to town to occupy the house which
Vavasour had taken and furnished in Sloane Street.
I need only mention that Katie accompanied us.</p>

<p class='c009'>Insufficient sleep and mental worry had by this time
thoroughly soured my temper no less than Vavasour’s.
When I charged him with secretly encouraging the presence
I had learned to hate, he rudely told me to think
as I liked! He implored my pardon for this brutality
afterwards upon his knees, and with the passage of time
I learned to endure the presence of his attendant shade
with patience. When she nocturnally hovered by the
side of my sleeping spouse, or in constituence no less
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>filmy than a whiff of cigarette-smoke, appeared at his
elbow in the face of day, I saw her plainly, and at
these moments she would favor me with a significant contraction
of the eyelid, which was, to say the least of it,
unbecoming in a spirit who had been a clergyman’s
daughter. After one of these experiences it was that
the idea which I afterwards carried into execution occurred
to me.</p>

<p class='c009'>I began by taking in a few numbers of a psychological
publication entitled <cite>The Spirit-Lamp</cite>. Then I formed
the acquaintance of Madame Blavant, the renowned Professoress
of Spiritualism and Theosophy. Everybody
has heard of Madame, many people have read her works,
some have heard her lecture. I had heard her lecture.
She was a lady with a strong determined voice and
strong determined features. She wore her plentiful
gray hair piled in sibylline coils on the top of her head,
and—when she lectured—appeared in a white Oriental
silk robe that fell around her tall gaunt figure in imposing
folds. This robe was replaced by one of black
satin when she held her <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">séances</span></i>. At other times, in the
seclusion of her study, she was draped in an ample gown
of Indian chintz innocent of cut, but yet imposing. She
smiled upon my new-born desire for psychic instruction,
and when I had subscribed for a course of ten private
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">séances</span></i> at so many guineas a piece she smiled more.</p>

<p class='c009'>Madame lived in a furtive, retiring house, situated
behind high walls in Endor’s Grove, N.W. A long glass
tunnel led from the garden gate to the street door, for
the convenience of Mahatmas and other persons who
preferred privacy. I was one of those persons, for
not for spirit worlds would I have had Vavasour know
of my repeated visits to Endor’s Grove. Before these
were over I had grown quite indifferent to supernatural
manifestations, banjos and accordions that were
thrummed by invisible performers, blood-red writing on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>mediums’ wrists, mysterious characters in slate-pencil,
Planchette, and the Table Alphabet. And I had made
and improved upon acquaintance with Simon.</p>

<p class='c009'>Simon was a spirit who found me attractive. He tried
in his way to make himself agreeable, and, with my secret
motive in view—let me admit without a blush—I
encouraged him. When I knew I had him thoroughly
in hand, I attended no more <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">séances</span></i> at Endor’s Grove.
My purpose was accomplished upon a certain night,
when, feeling my shoulder violently shaken, I opened
the eyes which had been closed in simulated slumber to
meet the indignant glare of my husband. I glanced over
his shoulder. Katie did not occupy her usual place. I
turned my glance towards the armchair which stood at
my side of the bed. It was not vacant. As I guessed,
it was occupied by Simon. There he sat, the luminously
transparent appearance of a weak-chinned, mild-looking
young clergyman, dressed in the obsolete costume of
eighty years previously. He gave me a bow in which
respect mingled with some degree of complacency, and
glanced at Vavasour.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have been explaining matters to your husband,”
he said, in that soundless spirit-voice with which Katie
had first made me acquainted. “He understands that I
am a clergyman and a reputable spirit, drawn into your
life-orbit by the irresistible attraction which your mediumistic
organization exercises over my——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There, you hear what he says!” I interrupted, nodding
confirmatively at Vavasour. “Do let me go to
sleep!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What, with that intrusive beast sitting beside you?”
shouted Vavasour indignantly. “Never!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Think how many months I have put up with the
presence of Katie!” said I. “After all, it’s only tit for
tat!” And the ghost of a twinkle in Simon’s pale eye
seemed to convey that he enjoyed the retort.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>Vavasour grunted sulkily, and resumed his recumbent
position. But several times that night he awakened me
with renewed objurgations of Simon, who with unflinching
resolution maintained his post. Later on I started
from sleep to find Katie’s usual seat occupied. She
looked less pert and confident than usual, I thought, and
rather humbled and fagged, as though she had had some
trouble in squeezing her way into Vavasour’s sleeping
thoughts. By day, after that night, she seldom appeared.
My husband’s brain was too much occupied
with Simon, who assiduously haunted me. And it was
now my turn to twit Vavasour with unreasonable jealousy.
Yet though I gloried in the success of my stratagem,
the continual presence of that couple of spooks was
an unremitting strain upon my nerves.</p>

<p class='c009'>But at length an extraordinary conviction dawned on
my mind, and became stronger with each successive
night. Between Simon and Katie an acquaintance had
sprung up. I would awaken, or Vavasour would arouse,
to find them gazing across the barrier of the bolster
which divided them with their pale negatives of eyes,
and chatting in still, spirit voices. Once I started from
sleep to find myself enveloped in a kind of mosquito-tent
of chilly, filmy vapor, and the conviction rushed
upon me that He and She had leaned across our couch
and exchanged an intangible embrace. Katie was the
leading spirit in this, I feel convinced—there was no
effrontery about Simon. Upon the next night I, waking,
overheard a fragment of conversation between them
which plainly revealed how matters stood.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We should never have met upon the same plane,”
remarked Simon silently, “but for the mediumistic intervention
of these people. Of the man”—he glanced
slightingly towards Vavasour—“I cannot truthfully say
I think much. The lady”—he bowed in my direction—“is
everything that a lady should be!”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>“You are infatuated with her, it is plain!” snapped
Katie, “and the sooner you are removed from her sphere
of influence the better.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Her power with me is weakening,” said Simon, “as
Vavasour’s is with you. Our outlines are no longer so
clear as they used to be, which proves that our astral
individualities are less strongly impressed upon the
brains of our earthly sponsors than they were. We are
still materialized; but how long this will continue——”
He sighed and shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t let us wait for a formal dismissal, then,” said
Katie boldly. “Let us throw up our respective situations.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I remember enough of the Marriage Service to make
our union, if not regular, at least respectable,” said Simon.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And I know quite a fashionable place on the Outside
Edge of Things, where we could settle down,” said
Katie, “and live practically on nothing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I blinked at that moment. When I saw the room
again clearly, the chairs beside our respective pillows
were empty.</p>

<p class='c009'>Years have passed, and neither Vavasour nor myself
has ever had a glimpse of the spirits whom we were the
means of introducing to one another. We are quite
content to know ourselves deprived for ever of their
company. Yet sometimes, when I look at our three babies,
I wonder whether that establishment of Simon’s
and Katie’s on the Outside Edge of Things includes a
nursery.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>THE WIDOW’S MITE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>People bestowed that nickname upon little Lord Garlingham
years ago, when he was the daintiest of human
playthings ever adored by a young mother. Shutting
my eyes, I can recall him, all golden curls and frills, sitting
on the front seat of the victoria with Toto, the Maltese.
Japanese pugs had not then come into fashion,
nor the ubiquitous automobile. Gar is the Widow’s Mite
still, but for other reasons. He was a charming, irresolute,
impulsive child, who invariably meant “macaroons”
when he said “sponge cake.” It recurs to me
that he was passionately fond of dolls, not nigger Sambo
dolls, or sailor dolls, or Punchinelli with curved caps
and bells, or policemen with large feet so cunningly
weighted that it is next door to impossible to knock them
over, but frilled and furbelowed dollies of the gentler
sex. There was a blue princess in tulle with a glass
chandelier-drop tiara, and a dancing girl in pink, and
a stout, shapeless, rag lady, whose features were painted
on the calico ball that represented her head, and whose
hair resembled the fringe of a black woollen shawl.
Holding her by one leg, Gar would sink to sleep upon
his lace-trimmed pillows in a halo of shining curls, and
Lady Garlingham’s last new friend or latest new adorer
would be brought up to the night nursery for an after-dinner
peep at “my precious in his cot.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My precious” was equally charming in his Eton
days, when his sleepy green eyes looked up at you from
under a lock of fair silky hair that was never to be kept
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>within regulation School bounds, but continually strayed
upon the fair, if freckled, expanse of a brow which might
have been the home of a pure and innocent mind, and
probably was not. He had a pleasant treble boy’s voice
and a beautiful smile, particularly when his mother told
him he might smoke just one cigarette, of her own special
brand, as a great treat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mother’s are hay,” he said afterwards in confidence,
and added that he preferred cut Cavendish, and that the
best way to induce a meerschaum to color was to smoke
it foul, and never to remove the dottle. But Lady Garlingham
was never the wiser. She had the utmost faith
in her boy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gar will be a dab at Classics,” she said with pride.
“Fancy his knowing that Dido was a heathen goddess,
and Procrustes was a Grecian King who murdered his
mother and afterwards put out his own eyes! I must
really give his tutor a hint not to bring him on <em>too</em> fast.
He will have to make his own way in the world, poor
dear, that is certain; but I don’t want him to turn out
a literary genius with eccentric clothes, or anything in
the scientific line that isn’t careful about its nails and
doesn’t comb its hair.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Garlingham’s clothes are always of the latest fashion
and in the most admirable taste. His hair is as well
groomed, his hands are as immaculate as any mother’s
heart could desire, and he has not turned out a genius.
During his career at Oxford he did not allow his love of
study to interfere with the more serious pursuit of athletic
distinction. He left the University unburdened
with honors, carrying in his wake a string of bills as long
as a kite’s tail. Relieved of this by the sacrifice of some
of Lady Garlingham’s diamonds, the kite shot up into
the empyrean in the wake of a dazzling star of the comic-opera
stage.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, thank Heaven, the boy has principles,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>breathed Lady Garlingham. “He never dreamed of
marrying her!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Garlingham descended from the skies ere long, tangled
in a telegraphic wire, and went into the Diplomatic
Service. He became fourth under-secretary at an Imperial
foreign Embassy, in virtue of the marriage of his
maternal aunt with Prince John Schulenstorff-Wangelbrode
(who was Military Attaché in the days of the
pannier and the polonaise, the bustle and the fringed
whip-parasol). I have not the least idea in what Garlingham’s
duties consisted, and the dear fellow was
diplomatically reticent when sounded on the subject; but
of one thing I am sure, that few young men have worn
an official button and lapels with greater ease and distinction.
He quite adored his mother, and made her his
<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">confidante</span></i> in all his love affairs. Indeed I believe Lady
Garlingham kept a little register of these at one time
on the sticks of an ivory fan—those that were going off,
those that were in full bloom, and those that were just
coming on; and posted up dates and set down names with
the utmost regularity.</p>

<p class='c009'>For, like the typical butterfly, Garlingham sipped
every flower and changed every hour. A very mature
Polly has now his passion requited, and if human happiness
depended on avoirdupois, and it were an established
mathematical fact that the felicity of the object
attracted may be calculated by the dimensions of the
object attracting, then is the handsome boy I used to
tip a happy man indeed.</p>

<p class='c009'>For Gar, “that pocket edition of Apollo,” as a Royal
personage with a happy knack at nicknames termed him—Gar
has married a middle-aged, not too good-looking,
extremely fat widow, unknown to fame as Mrs. Rollo
Polkingham. The couple were Hanover Squared in
June. Leila and Sheila Polkingham made the loveliest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>pair of Dresden china bridesmaids imaginable, and a
Bishop tied the knot, assisted by the brother of the bride,
the Reverend Michael O’Halloran, of Mount Slattery,
County Quare, a surpliced brogue with a Trinity College
B.A. hood. The hymns that were sung by the choir
during the ceremony were, “The Voice that Breathed,”
and “Fight the Good Fight,” and the bride looked quite
as bridal as might have been expected of a thirty-eight
inch girth arrayed in the latest heliotrope shade. She
became peony, Garlingham pale blue, when the moment
arrived for him to pronounce his vows, and a voice—a
high, nasal voice of the penetrating, saw-edged American
kind—said, several pews behind, quite audibly: “Well,
I call it child-stealing!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The owner of that voice was at the reception in Chesterfield
Crescent. So was I, and when Garlingham
thanked me for a silver cigar-box I had sent him in memory
of our old friendship, his hand was damp and clammy,
though he smiled. The Dowager Lady Garlingham,
looking much younger than her daughter-in-law, floated
across to ask me why I never came to see her now, and
Gar drifted away. Later, I had a fleeting glimpse of
the bridegroom standing in the large, cool shadow of
his newly-made bride, looking helplessly from one to
the other of his recently-acquired stepdaughters. Then
my circular gaze met and merged in the still attractive
eyes of Lady Garlingham.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You heard,” she breathed in her old confidential
way, “what that very outspoken person—I think a Miss
Van Something, from Philadelphia—said in church?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I did hear,” I returned, “and, while I deplored her
candor, I could not but admit——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That she had hit off the situation with dreadful
accuracy—I felt that, too,” sighed Gar’s mother.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We are old friends, or were,” said I, for people always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>became sentimental in the vicinity of Lady Garlingham.
“Tell me how it happened!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, how——” Lady Garlingham adroitly turned a
slight groan into a little cough. “Indeed, I hardly know.
All that seems burned into me is that I have become a
dowager without adequate cause.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Her pretty brown eyebrows crumpled; she dabbed her
still charming eyes with an absurd little lace handkerchief.
She wore a wonderful dress of something filmy
in Watteau blue, and a Lamballe hat with a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">paradis</span></i>.
Through innumerable veils of tulle her complexion was
really wonderful, considering, and her superb hair still
tawny gold.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t look at me and ask yourself why I’ve never
married again,” she commanded, in the old petulant
way. “For Gar’s sake, is the stereotyped answer to
that. And when I look at <em>her</em>——” She dabbed away
a tear with the absurd little handkerchief. “She hasn’t
had the indecency to call me ‘Mother’ <em>yet</em>.... But
she will, I know she will! If she doesn’t, she is more
than human. I have said such things to <em>her</em>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can quite believe it,” I agreed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Champagne cups were going about; infinitesimal sandwiches,
tabloids of condensed indigestion, were being
washed down. The best man, an Attaché friend of Garlingham’s,
brandishing a silver-handled carving-knife,
was encouraging the bridling bride to attack the cake.
Sheila and Leila hovered near with silver baskets, and
Garlingham, with the merest shadow of his old easy
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">insouciance</span></i>, was replying to the statute and legendary
chaff of the other men.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You know he was engaged to the second girl, Sheila,
first?” went on Lady Garlingham plaintively.</p>

<p class='c009'>I had not known it, and it gave me a thrill.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed!” I said in a tone of polite inquiry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When he was a very little boy, and I took him into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>a shop to buy a toy,” said poor Lady Garlingham, “he
always was in raptures with it, whatever it was, until
we were half-way home, and <em>then</em> nothing would satisfy
him but the carriage being turned round and driven
back, so that he might exchange the thing for something
he had particularly disliked at first.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I recalled the trait in my own experience of my young
friend.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, yes. He always took <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pralines</span></i> when he really
wanted chocolate fondants,” sighed his mother. “And
then—but perhaps you have forgotten—the dolls?”</p>

<p class='c009'>I had forgotten the dolls. I suppose I gaped rather
stupidly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He had three,” gulped Lady Garlingham. “He
chose the blue one first, and then, when we had just
reached Hyde Park Gate, he cried, and said it was the
pink one he had wanted all along. So we went back and
got her, and drove home to lunch, which, of course, was
Gar’s dinner. And then, if you had seen him, poor darling,”—her
maternal bosom heaved with a repressed
sob—“with his underlip turned down in a quite South
Sea Island way, and the tears tumbling into his rice
pudding because the blue creature was absolutely his
ideal from the first, you would have been foolish enough
to order the carriage and drive him back to the Regent
Street toyshop.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“As you did?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“As I did,” admitted Lady Garlingham.</p>

<p class='c009'>“With the result that might have been expected?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“With the result that seems to me <em>now</em> to be a hateful
foreshadowing of what was to be my poor darling’s
fate in life,” said the poor darling’s mother.... “No,
thank you, Sheila dear, I positively could not touch it,”
she added, as the cake-basket came our way. “Not even
to dream on—I have quite done with dreaming now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But how,” I asked hypercritically, “could Garlingham’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>subsequent choice of the blue doll, originally discarded
in favor of the pink, foreshadow his ultimate
fate in life?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, don’t you understand?” quavered poor Lady
Garlingham. “He went into the toyshop by himself,
and came marching out with what the Americans call a
rag-baby, the most odious, distorted, shapeless horror you
can imagine. It fascinated him by its sheer ugliness.
He was obsessed, magnetized, compelled.... As in this
case!” A burst of confidence broke down the floodgates
of the poor woman’s reserve. She grasped me by
the arm as she gurgled out hysterically—rocking her
slight form to and fro: “My dear, <em>she</em> is the rag-doll,
this awful widow creature Garlingham has married.
And to his fatal curse of indecision he owes the Incubus
that is crushing him to-day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The bride had tripped upstairs to put on her going-away
gown, attended by Leila and Sheila and some
freshly-married women, who meant to struggle for the
slippers for second choice.</p>

<p class='c009'>Loud, explosive bursts of jeering merriment came
from the dining-room, where most of the men of the
party had congregated. An exhausted maid and a very
obvious private detective hovered in the neighborhood
of the display of wedding presents, and through the
open door of the drawing-room one caught a glimpse of
suspiciously new luggage piled up in the hall, and a
little group of youths and maidens of the callower kind,
who were industriously packing the sunshades and umbrellas
in the holdalls with rice and confetti.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My poor, poor boy has been in and out of love <em>hundreds</em>
of times,” moaned the despairing Dowager, “without
once having been actually engaged. So that when I
saw Gar with these three women sitting on four green
chairs in the Park in May, I was not seriously alarmed.
Georgiana Bayham told me that the stout woman with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>too many bangles was a Mrs. Rollo Polkingham, a widow,
of whom nobody who might with truth be styled anybody
had ever heard, and that she had a wild, jungly
house in Chesterfield Crescent—(don’t those climbing
peacocks in the wall-paper set your teeth on edge?)—and
always asked young men to call—and wanted to
know their intentions at the third visit.... ‘I would
give this turquoise charm off my <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">porte-bonheur</span></i>,’ said
Georgiana, in her loud, bubbling voice, ‘to know which
of the two daughters Gar is smitten with. The girl with
the eyes like black ballot-balls, or the other with the
Gaiety smile.’ ... My dear, it was the dark one, Leila,
as it happened. Not that Gar flirted desperately. But
they went to Hurlingham and lunched at Prince’s, and
then the mother thought my boy hooked, and
struck——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Asked his intentions?” I hinted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I knew something had happened,” said Gar’s
mother, “when he came in to tea with me that very
afternoon. ‘Mother, am I a villain?’ were his very
words. ‘No, dear,’ I said, ‘do you feel like one?’ Then
it came out that the Polkingham woman had asked his
intentions with regard to Leila; and never having had
such a thing done to him before, poor, dear boy! Gar was
quite prostrated. He did not deny that he found the
eldest Polkingham girl attractive, but secretly he had
been more closely drawn to the second, Sheila.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The pink doll,” I murmured.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He behaved with the nicest honor in the matter,” declared
Lady Garlingham. “When he told me he was
really in love with Sheila, and could never be happy until
he had married her—and how a young woman with
such a muddy complexion could inspire such a passion I
don’t pretend to know—I said: ‘Very well, you have
my permission to tell her so. I shall never stand in the
way of your happiness, my son—although these people
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>are not in Our Set.’ If you had seen his shining eyes.
If you had heard the thrill in his voice as he said, ‘What
a rattling good sort you are, mother!’ you would have
felt with me that the sacrifice was worth it. And then
he rushed off in a hansom to declare himself.” Lady
Garlingham clutched my arm painfully.</p>

<p class='c009'>“To declare himself to Sheila?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And came back within the space of half an hour
engaged to Leila,” panted Lady Garlingham. “No,
don’t laugh!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The b-blue d-doll!” I gasped.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He was as pale as death!” said his mother. “He
had found Leila in the drawing-room in a becoming half-light,
and been taken off his guard.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And metaphorically he told the shopwoman he would
prefer that one,” I said shakily. “I understand! Was
he very unhappy over his bargain?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Frightfully out of sorts and off color,” said the
wooer’s mother, “until at a crisis, a month later, I
nerved him to go and see the mother and explain the
mistake.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And did he?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will say Mrs. Polkingham took the revelation in
good part,” said Lady Garlingham. “Leila cried a good
deal, I believe, when she turned Gar over to Sheila, and
Sheila was not disagreeably inclined to crow. I must
give the girls credit for their behavior. As for Gar, he
was the very picture of young, ardent happiness.
‘Mother,’ I can hear him saying, ‘thanks to you, I have
won the dearest and loveliest girl in the world.’ (Poor
boy!) ‘And I’m as happy as a gardener.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did that phase last long?” I queried, with twitching
facial muscles.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He began to flag, as it were, in about six weeks,” said
Garlingham’s mother mournfully. “My poor, affectionate,
<em>wobbly</em> boy. The sky of his simple happiness was
overcast. There came a day when the floodgates of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>resolve to go through with everything at any cost—sacrifice
himself for the sake of his duty and for the credit
of his family name——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Noblesse oblige</span></i>,” I stammered chokily. “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Noblesse
oblige.</span></i>”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The floodgates were broken down,” said his mother,
with a tremble in her voice. “His heart reverted with
a bound to the—the other—to Leila.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To the blue doll!” I spluttered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When he entreated me,” went on Lady Garlingham,
“begged me even with tears to be his ambassadress to
Leila, I grieve to say that for the first time in his life I
failed to rise to the occasion of his need. I said: ‘I shall
do nothing of the kind. Get out of the muddle as you
can—I wash my hands of it.’ And he thought me very
hard and very unfeeling, I know; but even when the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bouleversement</span></i> was managed for the third time, I could
not bring myself to regard the position from my usually
philosophical point of view. It was too cruel. The retransfer
of the engagement-ring, for instance——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, true,” I murmured, “and the presents!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Too painful!” sighed Lady Garlingham. “It was
ultimately arranged by Gar’s buying a new ring, and
Sheila’s dropping the old one into the almsbag at St.
Baverstock’s. Poor girl! I will say her demeanor in
the trying circumstances was admirable.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“As for the other?” I hinted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Leila is not a refined type of girl,” said Lady Garlingham
decidedly. “Her whole expression was that of
a Bank Holiday tripper young person who has just dismounted
from one of those giddy-go-rounds. Boat-swings
might impart the dazed look. The mother seemed
harassed. As for Gar——”</p>

<p class='c009'>I guessed what was coming, but I would not have
missed hearing Lady Garlingham tell it for worlds.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There came a day—a dreadful, dreadful day,” she
said, with pale lips, “when Gar told me that his life was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>ruined <em>unless he changed back</em>! We had a <em>dreadful
scene</em>, and for the first time in my life I had hysterics.
Then the unhappy boy tore from the house—<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ventre à
terre</span></i>—leaving me a perfect wreck, held up by my maid
Pinner—you know Pinner?”</p>

<p class='c009'>I nodded speechlessly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My wretched boy tore from the house, jumped into
his ‘Gohard,’ which was standing at the door—hurtled
to Chesterfield Crescent—told the painful truth——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Swopped dolls yet once again, and came back with
the rag-baby,” I gasped.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>And</em> now,” groaned Lady Garlingham, “he has to
carry it through life!”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a gabbling on the upper landing. The
bride was coming down in a white cut-cloth, tailor-made
gown and a picture hat, Leila and Sheila and a bonneted
maid following. The bridegroom, in immaculate tweeds,
appeared at a lower door, the smug face of his valet
behind him. There was a rush of women, an insane
kissing and shaking of hands, a glare of red carpet, a
flapping of striped awning. Rice and confetti impregnated
the air, the doorsteps were swamped with smartly-dressed
people. The chauffeur of Gar’s “Gohard” with
a giant favor in the buttonhole of his livery coat grinned
when Garlingham leaped tigerishly upon him and tore
it from his chest. The automobile moved on, pursued
by farewells. Some one had thoughtfully attached two
slippers to its rearward steps, a stout, elderly, white
satin slipper and a slim masculine, evening shoe of the
pump kind, almost new.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Say!” said the saw-edged American voice I had
heard in the church—“say, won’t the car-conductor allow
she’s traveling with her little boy? What will folks
call him, anyhow?”</p>

<p class='c009'>My mouth was on a level with the speaker’s back hair.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Widow’s Mite,” I said aloud—and fled.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>SUSANNA AND HER ELDERS</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c016'>I</h3>

<p class='c017'>The Earl of Beaumaris, a worthy and imposing personage,
flushed from the nape of his neck to the high summit
of his cranium—premature baldness figured amongst
the family heredities—paced, in creaking patent-leather
boots, up and down the castle library—a noble apartment
of Tudor design, lined with rare and antique volumes
into which none ever looked. There were other
persons present beside the Dowager Countess, and, to
judge by the strainedly polite expression of their faces,
the squeaking leather must have been playing havoc with
their nerves.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gustavus,” said the Dowager at length, “you’re an
English Peer in your own castle, and not a pointsman on
a Broadway block, unless I’m considerably mistaken.
Sit down!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mother, I will not be defied!” said Lord Beaumaris.
“I will not be bearded by my own child—a mere chit of
a girl! Had Susanna been a boy I should have known
how to deal with this spirit of insubordination. Being
a girl—and moreover, motherless—I abandon her to you.
She has many things to learn, but let the first lesson you
inculcate be this—that I positively refuse to be defied!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The child has, I gather, gone out to take the air
when she ought to have stayed in and taken a scolding,”
said Lady Beaumaris. “Does anybody know of her
whereabouts?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>Alaric Osmond-Omer, a languid, drab-complexioned,
light-haired man of aristocratic appearance, never seen
without the smoked eyeglass that concealed a diabolic
squint, spoke:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I saw her in a crimson golfing-jacket and a white
Tam-o’-shanter crossing the upper terrace. She carried
an alpenstock, and was followed by quite a pack
of dogs—incorporated in the body of one extraordinary
mongrel which I have occasionally observed about the
stable-yards. I gathered that she was going for a climb
upon the cliffs. That was about half an hour ago!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Alaric, you have attended every Family Council
that I recollect since I became a member of this family,
and have never before opened your lips,” said Lady
Beaumaris, fixing the unfortunate Alaric with her eye,
which was still black and snappingly bright. “Make
this occasion memorable by offering a suggestion. You
really owe us one!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Everybody present looked at Alaric, who smiled helplessly
and dropped his eyeglass, revealing the physical
peculiarity it concealed. The effect of the diabolic
squint, in combination with his mild features and somewhat
foolish expression, conveyed a general impression
of reserve force. He spoke, fumbling for the missing
article, which had plunged rapturously into his bosom,
with long, trim fingers, encrusted with mourning rings.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The question at issue is—unless I have failed in my
mental digest of the situation—how to bring Susanna
Viscountess Lymston—pardon me if I indulge a little
my weakness for prolixity——”</p>

<p class='c009'>The door creaked, and Alaric broke off.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear man,” said the Dowager, “I never before
heard you utter a sentence of more than two words’
length!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“—To bring Susanna, who is just seventeen and
fiercely virginal in her expressed aversion to, and avoidance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>of, ordinary, everyday Man—into compliance with
your paternal wishes”—Alaric bowed to Lord Beaumaris—“where
the encouragement of a suitor is concerned!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have appealed to her filial feelings—which do not
appear to exist,” said Lord Beaumaris; “I have appealed
to her reason—I doubt gravely whether the girl
possesses any: ‘There is too much landed property,
there are too many houses and too many heirlooms, and
there is not enough ready money to keep things going,’
I said. Her reply was: ‘Sell some of the land and some
of the houses and all of the pictures, and then there will
be enough to keep up the rest.’ ‘My dear child, is it
possible,’ I said, ‘that at your age, and occupying the
position you occupy, you have no idea of what is meant
by an Entail?’ Then I made her sit down here, in this
library, opposite me, and laid plainly before her why it
is necessary for her, as my daughter, to marry, and to
marry Wealth, Position, and Title. Before I had ended
she rose with a flaming face and burst into an hysterical
tirade, which lasted ten minutes. I gather that she was
willing to marry Sir Prosper Le Gai or the Knight of
the Swan if either of these gentlemen proposed for her
hand. Neither being available, she intends, I gather, to
write great poems, or paint great pictures, or go upon
the stage.... Go upon the stage! My blood curdled
at the bare idea. It is still in that unpleasant condition.”
Lord Beaumaris shuddered violently, and
pressed his handkerchief to his nose. “If you have any
advice to give, Alaric,” he said bluntly, “oblige us by
giving it. We are at a positive crux!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The drab-complexioned, light-haired Alaric responded:</p>

<p class='c009'>“In my poor opinion—which may be crassly wrong—too
much stress has been laid upon the necessity of Susanna’s
marrying.” At this point the contrast between
the amiable vacuity of Alaric’s face and the Mephistophelian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>intelligence of his monocled eye was so extraordinary
as to hold his listeners spellbound in their chairs.
“I think we may take it that the principal feature of
the child’s character is—call it determination amounting
to obstinacy——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Crass obstinacy!” burst from the Earl.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pig-headedness!” interjected the Dowager.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think I remember hearing that in her nursery days
the sure way to make her take a dose of harmless necessary
medicine,” pursued Alaric, his left eye fixed upon
the door, “was to prepare the potion, pill, or what-not,
sweeten, and then carefully conceal it from her. Were
she my daughter—which Heaven for—which Heaven has
not granted!—I should make her take a husband in the
same way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“An utterance possibly inspired, but as obscure as the
generality. I fear, my dear Alaric——” Lord Beaumaris
began. The Dowager cut him short.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Say, Gus, can’t you let him finish? That’s what I
call real mean—to switch a man off just when he’s beginning
to grip the track.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mother, I bow to you,” Lord Beaumaris said, purpling
with indignation. “Pray continue, Alaric!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hum along, Alaric,” encouraged the Dowager.</p>

<p class='c009'>Alaric, his countenance as the countenance of a little
child, his right eye beaming with mildness, and his left
eye as the eye of an intelligent fiend, went on:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Susanna has never yet seen the Duke of Halcyon—her
cousin, and the husband for whom you destine her.
When she does see him—I think I may be pardoned for
saying——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’ll raise Cain,” agreed Lady Beaumaris. “Girls
think such heaps of good looks; I was like that myself,
before I married your father, Gus.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear mother, granted that Halcyon’s gifts, both
physical and mental, are not”—the Earl coughed—“not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>of the kind best calculated to impress and win
upon a romantic, willful girl!... He is, to speak
plainly——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A hideous little Troglodyte,” nodded the Dowager,
over her interminable Shetland-wool knitting.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Odd, considering that his mother, when Lady Flora
MacCodrum, was, with the sole exception of myself, the
handsomest young woman presented in the Spring of
1845.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mother,” said Lord Beaumaris, “delightful as your
reminiscences invariably are, Alaric is waiting to resume.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I had merely intended to suggest,” said Alaric,
twirling his eyeglass by its black ribbon and turning his
demure drab-colored countenance and balefully glittering
left eye upon the Earl and the Dowager in turn,
“that the Duke of Halcyon, like the rhubarb of Susanna’s
infancy, should be rendered tolerable, agreeable,
and even desirable to our dear girl’s palate, by being
forbidden and withheld. Ask him here in September
for the partridge shooting—as I understand you
think of doing—but let him appear, not in his own character
as a young English Peer of immense wealth and
irreproachable reputation, but as one of those literary
and artistic Ineligibles, who are encouraged by Society
to take every liberty with it—short of marrying its
cousins, sisters, or daughters. Let him encourage his
hair to grow—wear a velvet coat, a flamboyant necktie,
and silk stockings in combination with tweed knickerbockers.
Let him pay attention to Susanna—as marked
as he chooses. And do you, for your part”—he fixed
Lord Beaumaris with his gleaming left eye—“discourage
those attentions, and lose no opportunity of impressing
upon your daughter that she is to discourage
them too. Given this tempting opportunity of manifesting
her independent spirit, you will find—or I know
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>nothing of Susanna—that it will be pull baker, pull
devil. And I know which will pull the hardest!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lord Beaumaris rose to his feet in superb indignation.
He struck the attitude in which he had posed for
his portrait, by Millais, which hung at the upper end
of the library, representing him in the act of delivering
his maiden speech in Parliament—an address advocating
the introduction of footwarmers into the Upper
House, and opened upon Alaric:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your proposal—I do not hesitate to say it—is audacious.
You deliberately expect that I—I, Gustavus
Templebar Bloundle-Abbott Bloundle, ninth Earl of
Beaumaris, and head of this ancient family—should
stoop to carry out a deception—and upon my only child.
That I should take advantage of her willful youth, her
undisciplined temper, to——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To bring about a match that will set every mother’s
mouth watering, and secure your daughter’s son a dukedom,
and a hundred and thirty thousand a year....
That’s so, and I guess,” said Lady Beaumaris, “you’ll
do it, Gus! You’re a representative English peer, it’s
true, but on my side you’ve Yankee blood in you, and
the grandson of Elijah K. Van Powler isn’t going to
back out of a little bluff that’s going to pay. No, sir!”
The Dowager ran her knitting-needles through her wool
ball, and rolled up her work briskly. “He’ll do it,
Alaric,” she said with conviction.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mother,” exclaimed the Earl in desperation. “You
were my father’s choice, and Heaven forbid that I
should fail in respect towards a lady whom he honored
with his hand. But when you suggest that to bring
about this most desirable union, I should wallow, metaphorically,
in dirt——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s pay dirt, Gus,” said the Dowager. “A hundred
and thirty thousand a year, my boy!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mother!” cried Lord Beaumaris. “If I brought myself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>to grovel to such infamy, do you suppose for one
moment Halcyon——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That Halcyon would tumble to the plot? There are
no flies on Halcyon,” said the Dowager, “and you bet
he’ll worry through—velvet coat, orange necktie, forehead,
curls, and all!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then do I understand,” said Lord Beaumaris helplessly,
“that I am to ask him to accept my hospitality
in a character that is not his own, and appear at my
table in a disguise! The idea is inexpressibly loathsome,
and I cannot imagine in what character he
could possibly appear.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“As a painter—of the fashionable fresco brand—engaged
if you like to decorate your new ballroom!”
put in Alaric in his level expressionless tones.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But he can’t paint!” said the Dowager. “That’s
where we’re going to buckle up and collapse. He can’t
paint worth a cent! That takes brain, and Halcyon
isn’t overstocked with ’em, I must allow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Get a man who has the brain and the ability to do
the work,” said the imperturbable Alaric.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Deception on deception!” groaned Lord Beaumaris.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have the very fellow in my eye,” pursued Alaric:
“Remarkable clever A.R.A., and a kinsman of your
own. Perhaps you have forgotten him,” he continued,
as Lord Beaumaris stiffened with polite inquiry, and
the Dowager elevated her handsome and still jetty eyebrows
into interrogative arches; “perhaps—it’s equally
likely—you never heard of him, but at least you remember
his mother, Janetta Bloundle?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She married a person professionally interested in
the restoration of Perpendicular churches,” said Lord
Beaumaris, “and though I cannot now recall his name,
I remember hearing of his death, and forwarding a brief,
condolatory postcard to his widow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who joined him, wherever he is, six months ago.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>“Dear me!” said Lord Beaumaris, “that is quite too
regrettable. However, it is too late in the day to send
another postcard addressed to the surviving members of
the family.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is only a son,” said Alaric, “and he is the
rising artist to whom I suggest that you should offer a
commission. He is strong in fresco, and has just executed
a series of wall cartoons for the new Naval and
Military Idiot Asylum, which will carry his name down
to the remotest posterity.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Might—I—ah!—ask his name?” said Lord Beaumaris.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wopse,” responded Alaric.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lord Beaumaris shuddered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And the Christian prefix?” He closed his eyes in
readiness for the coming shock.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Halcyon.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lord Beaumaris opened his eyes, and the Dowager
uttered a slight snort of astonishment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A relationship existing upon the mother’s side between
young Wopse and the ducal house of Halcyon,”
said Alaric, twirling his eyeglass faster: “it is not surprising
that the poor lady should have improved upon
the homespun Anglo-Saxonism of Wopse by the best
means in her power. At any rate the young fellow is
well-looking and well-bred enough to carry both names
in a creditable fashion.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ve taken considerable of a time about making
it,” said Lady Beaumaris, “but I’m bound to say your
suggestion ain’t worth shucks. Given the real artistic
and Bohemian article to nibble at, is a girl like Susanna
likely to swallow the imitation article? I guess not!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I concur entirely with my mother, Alaric,” said
Lord Beaumaris. “You propose, in the person of this
young man, to introduce an element of danger into our
limited September house-party.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>“You could let this Mr. Wopse live in the garden
<em>châlet</em>, and commission the keeper’s wife to attend to
him,” said the Dowager, “but even then, how are you
to make sure that——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That Susanna does not associate with him? There
is a simple method of divesting the young man of all
attraction for a young creature of our dear girl’s temperament,”
said Alaric, “but for several reasons I
shrink from recommending its selection.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pray mention it,” said Lord Beaumaris, with an
uneasy laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s hear it!” said Lady Beaumaris.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You have only,” said Alaric, with great distinctness,
“to call this young fellow by his Christian name;
to let him take Lady Beaumaris in to dinner; to put him
up in your best room—the Indian chintz suite—and
generally to foster the idea——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That he is the Duke of Halcyon!” cried the Dowager.
“My stars! what a Palais Royal farce to be
played under this respectable old roof.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You suggest a double—a doubly-infamous and objectionable
deception! Not a word more.... I will
not hear it!” Lord Beaumaris rapped decidedly on
the table, rose in agitation, and strode on creaking patent
leathers to the door. “The question is closed forever,”
said he, turning upon the threshold. “Let no
one refer to it again in my——”</p>

<p class='c009'>The door, which had occasionally creaked throughout
this discussion, smartly opened from without, and acting
upon the Earl’s offended person as a battering-ram,
caused him to run forwards smartly, tripping over the
edge of the worn, but still splendid Turkey carpet. Lord
Beaumaris saved himself by clinging to the high back of
an ancestral chair, upon the seat of which he subsided,
as the tall young figure of his daughter appeared on
the threshold, her Tam-o’-shanter cap, her long yellow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>locks, and her red golfing jacket shining with moisture,
her fresh cheeks red with the cold kisses of the March
winds.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It began to snow like Happy Jack,” said Susanna,
pulling off her rough beaver gauntlet gloves, “so I came
home. Well, have you all done plotting? You look
like conspirators—all—with the exception of Alaric.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This was true, for while the Earl, his mother, and
three other members of the family council, whom we
have not found it necessary to describe, wore an air
of somewhat guilty perturbation, the drab-colored, mild
countenance of Alaric, its diabolical left eye now blandly
shuttered with its tinted eyeglass, alone appeared guiltless
and unmoved.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ve been discussing the September house-party,”
explained this Catesby, as Susanna sat upon the elbow
of his chair and affectionately rumpled his sparse, light-colored
locks.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And husbands for me!” said Susanna, half throttling
Alaric with her strong young arm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Susanna!” cried her father. “I am surprised! I
say no more than that I am surprised!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And I say,” retorted Susanna, in clear, defiant, ringing
accents, as she swayed herself to and fro upon her
narrow perch, “that it is <em>beastly</em> to be expected to marry
just because money has got to be brought into the family.
Of course I <em>shall</em> marry one day—I don’t want
to study law, or be a hospital nurse like that idiotic
Laura Penglebury. But I don’t want to be a married
woman until I’m tired of being a girl. I want to have
lots of fun and do lots of things, and see lots of people,
and make my mind up for my own self. And——”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lord Beaumaris, who had long been fermenting,
frothed over. “When you form an alliance, my child,
you will form it with my sanction and my approval,
and the husband you honor with your hand will be a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>person selected and approved of by me. By me! I will
choose for you——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And suppose I choose for myself afterwards!” cried
Susanna, blue fire flashing from her defiant eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Every woman is at heart</em>—ahem!” muttered Alaric,
as Lord Beaumaris strove with incipient apoplexy. Susanna
continued, with a whimper in her voice:</p>

<p class='c009'>“The young men you and grandmother point out to
me as nice and eligible, and all that, are simply awful.
They have no chins, or too much, and no teeth, or too
many, and they don’t talk at all, or they gabble all the
time, about nothing. They never read, they don’t care
for Art or Poetry—they aren’t interested in anything
but Bridge and racing; and if you told them that Beethoven
composed the ‘Honeysuckle and the Bee,’ or that
Chopin wrote ‘When I Marry Amelia,’ they’d believe
you. They like married women better than girls, and
people who dance at theaters better than the married
women——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pet, you’d better go to Mademoiselle.... Ask her,
with my love, to fix you up some French history to
translate,” Lady Beaumaris suggested.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should prefer a Gallic verb,” Lord Beaumaris
amended. “I marry in accordance with my parents’
wishes. Thou marriest in accordance with thy parents’
wishes. He marries—and so on! And make a solid
schoolroom tea while you are about it, my child,” he
continued, as Susanna bestowed a parting strangle upon
Alaric, kicked over a footstool, and rose to leave the
room. “For I fear we are to be deprived of your society
at dinner this evening.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Susanna’s lovely red underlip pouted; her blue eyes
clouded with tears. She flashed a resentful look at her
sire, and went out.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She is not manageable by any ordinary methods,”
said Lord Beaumaris, running his forefinger round the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>inside of his collar, and shaking his head. “In such a
case Contumacy must be combated with Craft, and Defiance
met with Diplomacy. Alaric, regrettable as is
the course you have counseled us to pursue, I feel inclined
to adopt it.... I shall write to-night to make
an appointment on Wednesday with the Duke of Halcyon
at the Peers’ Club, and—I shall be obliged if you
will, at your early convenience—favor me with the address
of the young man Wopse.”</p>

<h3 class='c016'>II</h3>

<p class='c018'>The garden <em>châlet</em> was damp; it had been raining,
and the glittering appearance of the walls betrayed the
fact. “As though a bally lot of snails had been dancin’
a cotillon on ’em!” said the Duke of Halcyon. He
yawned dismally as he opened the casement and leaned
out, looking, in his gaudily-hued silken night-suit, like
a tulip drooping from the window-sill. Then the keeper’s
wife came splashing up the muddy path carrying a
tray covered with a mackintosh, and the knowledge that
his breakfast would presently be set before him, and
set before him in a lukewarm, flabby, and tepid condition,
caused Halcyon to groan. But presently, when
bathed, shaved, and attired in a neat knickerbocker suit
of tawny-orange velveteen, with green silk stockings
and tan shoes, salmon-colored silk shirt, rainbow necktie,
and Panama, he issued, cigarette in mouth, from
the <em>châlet</em>, and strolled in the direction of the newly-restored
west wing, his Grace’s equanimity seemed restored.
He even hummed a tune, which might have
been “The Honeysuckle and the Bee” or “God Save
the King,” as he mounted the short, wide, double flight
of marble steps that led from the terrace, and, pushing
open the glazed swing-doors, entered the ballroom, the
entire space of which was filled by a bewildering maze
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>of ropes and scaffolding, as though a giant spider had
spun a cobweb in hemp and pine. A smell of turpentine
and size was in the air, and a paint-table occupied a
platform immediately under the skylight dome, the
sides of which were already filled in with outlines, transferred
from cartoons designed by the artist engaged to
ornament the apartment. That gentleman, arrayed in a
blue canvas blouse and wearing a deerstalker cap on
the back of a well-shaped head, was actively engaged in
washing in the values of a colossal nude figure-group
with a bucket of sepia and a six-foot brush. He whistled
rather queerly as his bright eye fell upon the intruder.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re there, are you?” said the Duke unnecessarily.
“Shall I come up?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you can!” said Halcyon Wopse, with a decided
smile, that revealed a very complete set of very white
teeth. “But, to save time, perhaps I had better come
down to you.” And the painter swung himself lightly
down from stage to stage until he reached the ground-level
of his august relative.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Put what you’ve got to tell me as clearly as you
can,” said the Duke. “I never was a sap at Eton, and
the classical names of these Johnnies you’re thingambobbing
on the what’s-a-name rather queer me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The design outlined on the plaster in the central
space on the left-hand side of the skylight dome,” said
Wopse, A.R.A., “is the ‘Judgment of Paris.’ The three
figures of the rival goddesses are completely outlined,
but, as you see, Paris is only roughly blocked in.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t see a city,” said the Duke with some annoyance.
“I only see a bit of a man. And, as for being
block-tin——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Paris was a man—or, rather, a youth,” said Halcyon
Wopse, quoting—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Fair and disdainfully lidded, the Shepherd of Ida,</div>
      <div class='line'>Holding the golden apple, desired of——’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>“Hold on! When people get spouting it knocks me
galley-west,” said the Duke. “Just tell me plainly what
the beggar was to judge? Goddesses? I savvy! And
which of ’em took the biscuit—I mean the apple? Venus?
Right you are! That’s as much as I can hold
at one time, thanky!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sorry if I’ve over-estimated the extent of the accommodation,”
said Halcyon Wopse, smiling and lighting
a cigar.</p>

<p class='c009'>“One of the Partagas. Now, hang it,” said the Duke,
“that is infernally stupid of my man.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of my man, you mean,” corrected the painter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I begin to think,” said the Duke, “that I have,
in falling in with the absurd plot, cooked up by that old
footler, Beaumaris, and swopping characters with a
beg—with an artist fellow like you, in order to take the
fancy of a long-haired, long-legged colt of a girl——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I presume you allude to Lady Lymston?” put in
the painter coldly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course. I say, in tumblin’ to the idea and embarkin’
in the game, I’ve made an ass of myself,” said
the Duke. “As for you, you’re in clover.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Say nettles,” sighed the painter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Passin’ under my name——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pardon,” said the painter. “The name is my own.
And let us say, simply, that in changing identities with
your Grace in order to enable your Grace to cast a
glamour of artistic romance over a very ordinary——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Eh?” interjected the Duke.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Situation,” continued the painter. “In doing this
I have laid up for myself a considerable store of regret.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Regret! Why, hang you! You’re chalkin’ up
scores the whole bally time!” shrieked the Duke, stamping
his tan shoes on the canvas-protected parquet. “Beaumaris’s
guests—only a few purposely selected fogies and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>duffers, who don’t count, it’s true—believe you to be
me. They flatter you and defer to you. You take the
Dowager in to dinner, and I’m left to toddle after with
Susanna’s French governess. I’m out of everything—and
obliged to talk Art, bally Art—from mornin’ till
night! While you—you’ve ridden to cub-hunts on my
mounts—driven my motor-cars and bust my tires——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And very bad ones they are,” said the painter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You ride infernally well, and show off before the
field at Henworthy Three Gates, where the hardest riders
in the county hang back. You ain’t afraid of a trappy
take-off—you weren’t built for a broken neck,”
screeched the incensed Peer. “You play golf too, and
win the Coronation Challenge Cup for the Lymston
Club, takin’ seven holes out of the eighteen, and holin’
the round in the score of sixty-eight.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was my duty to maintain the honor of your
Grace’s rank once I had consented to assume it,” said
the painter with a bow.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you’re a dead shot, confound you, knockin’
the birds over right and left, and getting a par. in
every sportin’ newspaper for a record bag of four hundred.
You’re a polo player too—hit a ball up and
down the field and through the goals at each end, and
look as if you didn’t care whether the ladies applauded
you or not, da—hang you! And you must own to bein’
a bit of a cricketer, and consent to play in the County
Match on Thursday, and I wouldn’t like to bet against
your chances of makin’ a big score—an all-round admirable
what’s-a-name of a fellow like you!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps you’d better not,” the painter remarked
calmly, knocking off the ash of his cigar. “But I should
be glad to know the reason for this display of temper
on your Grace’s part, all the same,” he added. “If I
rode like a tailor and shot like a duffer, hit your ponies’
legs instead of the ball, and played cricket like a German
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>governess at a girls’ boarding-school, I could understand——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t you understand when I get back into my own
skin again, I’ll have to live up to the reputation you’ve
made me?” yelled Halcyon. “I could pass muster
before because nobody looked for anything. But
now....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And what of my reputation? I think I heard you
telling Susanna——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Susanna!” echoed the Duke.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She is Susanna to your Grace. Did I not hear you
telling her that Chiaroscuro was an Italian painter of
the Cinquecento—who, you said, was a Pope who patronized
Art! You went on to say that Chiaroscuro lived
on hard eggs, and designed carnival cars, and that Benvenuto
Cellini won the Gold Cup at Ascot Race Meeting
in ’91.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look here, we won’t indulge in mutual recriminations.
It’s beastly bad form!” said the Duke. “And
though you can ride and all that, I never said I thought
you could paint for nuts! In fact, between ourselves,
I don’t half like havin’ these spooks on the ceilin’ set
down to me.” He twisted his sandy little moustache,
and fixed his eyeglass in his eye, and started. “Here’s
Lady Lymston comin’ over the lawn with a whole pack
of dogs, to ask me how I’ve got on since yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Take my blouse!” The painter denuded himself of
the turpentiny garment, appearing in a well-cut tweed
shooting-suit.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Get into that rag! Not me, thanks! Hand over your
brush, and give me a leg up on that scaffoldin’, like a
good chap. I’d better be discovered at work, I suppose,”
said his Grace of Halcyon, as he slowly mounted to the
platform under the dome.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had just reached it when Susanna’s fresh young
voice was heard outside calling to her dogs, and a moment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>later she appeared. Her fair cheeks were flushed,
her blue eyes were bright with exercise. She wore a
rough gray skirt, which, if less abbreviated than of yore,
still showed a slim, arched foot and suggested a charming
ankle. Her white silk blouse was confined by a Norwegian
belt, and a loose <em>beret</em> cap of black velvet
crowned her yellow head, its silken riches being now
disposed in a great coil, through which a silver arrow
was carelessly thrust. She started and reddened from
her temples to the edge of lace at her round throat when
the tweed-clad figure of the painter caught her eye, and
gave him her hand with an indifference which was too
ostentatious.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I didn’t know you were interested in Art,” she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh yes!” responded the painter. “At least, if this
can be called Art,” he added modestly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Ssh!” warned Susanna. “He is up there, and will
hear you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He?” echoed the painter, reveling in the blush.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did I hear my name?” called the Duke sweetly, from
above. “Hulloa, Lady Lymston, that you? Come to
record progress? As you see, we’re going strong.” His
six-foot brush menaced a Juno’s draperies, a gallipot
of size upset, trickled its contents through the planking;
his velveteen coat-tails placed Paris in peril, as he turned
his back to the cartoon and resting his hands upon his
knees, assumed a stooping attitude, and peered waggishly
down over the edge of the scaffolding at Susanna.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Take care—you!” shouted the painter, forgetting
his aristocratic <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôle</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My foot is on my native thingumbob, ain’t it, Lady
Lymston?” said the owner of the small, cockneyfied,
grinning countenance above. “How do you like the
wax-works? This is the”—he flourished the six-foot
brush perilously—“this is the Judgment of Berlin.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>“Paris!” prompted the false Duke hoarsely.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He is trying to joke,” said Susanna, in an undertone.
“Don’t discourage him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should think that would be difficult,” remarked
Wopse grimly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Papa tries to be crushing, and Cousin Alaric’s rudeness
is simply appalling,” said Susanna, in a confidential
undertone. “And grandmother walks over him as
though he were a beetle—no! she would run away from
a thing like that—I should say an earwig or a snail, so
one feels bound to be a <em>little</em> nice.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If only out of opposition!” said the painter, with
a keen look of intelligence, at which Susanna blushed
again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He is idiotic when he tries to be funny about Art—and
mixes up names and dates—and tells you that Titian
sang in opera and Rubens is a popular composer. But
he can paint, and Alaric Orme thinks he will be President
of the Academy one day. These cartoons are splendidly
bold and effective.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You think so! Wait till I’ve colored these girls
up a bit,” said the Duke, catching the end of the sentence.
“Then you’ll——” He dipped his brush and
advanced it, dripping with cobalt, towards the group of
goddesses.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t touch them!” shouted Wopse, in agony.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why not?” asked Susanna.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know. Excuse me, Lady Lymston, I believe
the smell of this size isn’t wholesome,” Wopse stammered.
“I’ll get out into the air.” He bolted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good Heavens!” he moaned, as he strode unseeing
down a broad path of the dazzling west front pasture,
“I can’t stand this! I’ll tell that idiot Osmond-Orme
that the deception must come to an end....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why do you walk so fast?” said the voice of Susanna,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>behind him. “I have had to <em>race</em> to catch you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am sorry,” said Wopse, stopping and turning his
troubled eyes upon the fair face of his young relation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let us walk on”—Susanna cast an apprehensive
glance behind her—“or somebody——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Somebody will see us walking together!” said Wopse
acutely.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is so much nicer,” Susanna said demurely, “when
one can keep pleasant things to oneself. And we have
had a good many walks and talks since you came down
here, haven’t we? And cliff scrambles—and bicycle
rides—and rows on the river. And the fun of it is that,
although we are such pals, really, father and grandmother
and Uncle Alaric believe that I positively detest
you.” Her young laugh rang out gayly; she thrust
a sprig of lavender, perfumed and spicy, under the
painter’s nose. He captured the tantalizing hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you not?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Detest you! You know I don’t.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“May I have it?” It was the sprig of lavender. But
the painter looked at, and squeezed, the hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you promise to make a big score on Thursday!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Susanna, it must be admitted, was learning coquetry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will—if you are looking at me!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Done!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Done! Come into the beech avenue,” the painter
pleaded, “just for a few moments, before that little
beast follows us. You know he will!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He can’t!” Susanna’s golden eyelashes drooped
upon crimson cheeks. “He can’t get down! I—I took
away the ladder before I came away!” she owned. Both
hands were imprisoned, her blue eyes lifted, lost themselves
in the brown ones that looked down at her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Was that because you wanted—to be alone with
me? Was it?” demanded Wopse.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>“Oh, Hal, don’t!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll let you go when you have owned up, not before,”
Wopse said sternly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Susanna’s reply came in a whisper: “You—know—it—was!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The whisper was so faint that Wopse had to bend
quite low to catch it. Of course he need not have kissed
Susanna. But he did, as Alaric Osmond-Orme and Lord
Beaumaris appeared, walking confidentially together
arm-in-arm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think my little stratagem succeeds!” Lord Beaumaris
had just said, in reference to the preference exhibited
by his daughter for the society of the pretended
painter. And Alaric had responded:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, as you say, my plan has proved quite a brilliant
success!” when Lord Beaumaris clutched his
cousin’s arm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Merciful powers! Susanna and that—that young
impostor!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Alaric’s eyeglass fell with a click, and the diabolical
left eye twirled and twisted fiendishly in its socket as its
retina embraced the picture indicated.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Feign not to have observed.... Well, Susanna!
How are you, Halcyon. We are strolling towards the
ballroom for a glimpse of Wopse’s work.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We are stro——” Lord Beaumaris choked and purpled.
Alaric dragged him on.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you think?...” Susanna’s cheeks were white
roses now. “Do you think—they——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Saw me kiss you? Not a doubt of it!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” Susanna confronted him with blazing eyes.
“You!—you did it on <em>purpose</em>! It was a plot——”</p>

<p class='c009'>She clenched her strong young hands, battling with
the desire to buffet the handsome bronzed face before
her. “I’ll never—never speak to you again!” she cried.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You will not be allowed to,” groaned the poor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>painter. “Our walks and rides and all the rest are
over.... Yes, there has been a plot, but not of the
kind you suspect. I am a traitor—but not the kind of
traitor you think me. Lady Lymston, I am not the
Duke of Halcyon. I am a poor devil—I beg your pardon!—I
am a painter; my name is Wopse, and I have
disgraced my profession by the part I have played!”
He sat down miserably on a rustic bench.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! It has been a put-up thing between you all!”
Susanna gasped. “Oh!” She towered over Wopse like
an incensed young goddess.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If I could only paint you like that! Yes—I deserve
that you should hate me. Never mind who planned
the thing, I should have known better than to soil my
hands with a deception,” said Wopse. “As for the
Duke——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Duke! Do I understand that that earwig in
velveteen is my cousin Halcyon!” Susanna’s voice was
very cold.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes. I am a kind of cousin, too,” said Wopse.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But not that kind. Those—those designs—the work
on the ceiling. They are really yours?” Susanna asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mine, of course. Do you think that fellow could
have done them?” cried Wopse, firing up. “I’ve risen
at four every morning to work at them, and——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you ride splendidly, and you’re a crack shot
and polo player, and you’re going to win for the county
Eleven on Thursday,” came breathlessly from Susanna.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, you won’t care to look at me now!” said the
depressed Wopse.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Won’t I?” Susanna’s eyes were dancing, her
cheeks were glowing, she pirouetted on the moss-grown
ground of the avenue and dropped a little curtsey to
the painter. “When doing it will drive father and
grandmother and Alaric and the Earwig wild with rage....
When—when I like doing it, too! When——” she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>stooped, and her lips were very near Wopse’s cheek—“when
I love doing it!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Susanna!” cried the painter.</p>

<p class='c014'>“My dear Halcyon!” said Lord Beaumaris, peering
short-sightedly upwards through a maze of scaffolding.
“I think you may as well come down.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In other words—the game is up!” said Alaric Osmond-Orme
mildly. “Come down, my dear fellow, and
resume your own <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôle</span></i> of hereditary legislator. Allow
me to replace the ladder.” He did so.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So that fellow’s done me! I guessed as much when
that little—when Susanna took away the ladder,” said
the Duke, preparing to descend. “And then when I
saw him kiss her—there’s a remarkably good view of
the gardens through the end window. I——” He
pointed to some remarkable effects of color splashed upon
the ground so carefully prepared by the painter. “I
took it out of the beggar in the only way I could, don’t
you know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Take it out of him still more,” suggested Alaric, his
tinted eyeglass concealing a fiendish twinkle, “by playing
in the County Cricket Match. He’s entered in your
name, you know!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re very obligin’,” said the Duke, “but I don’t
think I’m taking any.” He gracefully slithered to the
floor as Susanna and Halcyon Wopse entered the ballroom,
radiant and hand in hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Papa,” said Susanna, taking the bull by the horns,
“Mr. Wopse and I are engaged. We mean to be married
as soon as possible after the County Cricket Match.”
She kissed the perturbed countenance of Lord Beaumaris,
nodded to the Duke, and walked over to Alaric.
“Your plan has succeeded beautifully,” she said. “Ain’t
you pleased—and won’t you congratulate us?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am delighted,” said the imperturbable Alaric. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>dropped his eyeglass and before the preternatural intelligence
of his left eye even Susanna quailed. “And
I congratulate you both most heartily.” He smiled, and
pressed the hands of Susanna and her lover, and, moving
away, stepped into the garden. There, unseen, he
rubbed his hands, twinkling with mourning rings.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I loved that boy’s mother very dearly, boy as I
was then ...” said Alaric. “As for Susanna, if she
knew that I knew she was listening at the library
door....” He replaced his eyeglass, and his expression
became, as usual, a blank.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>LADY CLANBEVAN’S BABY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>There was a gray, woolly October fog over Hyde Park.
The railings wept grimy tears, and the damp yellow
leaves dropped soddenly from the soaked trees. Pedestrians
looked chilled and sulky; camphor chests and
cedar-presses had yielded up their treasures of sables
and sealskin, chinchilla and silver fox. A double stream
of fashionable traffic rolled west and east, and the rich
clarets and vivid crimsons of the automobiles burned
through the fog like genial, warming fires.</p>

<p class='c009'>A Baby-Bunting six horse-power petrol-car, in color a
chrysanthemum yellow, came jiggeting by. The driver
stopped. He was a technical chemist and biologist of
note and standing, and I had last heard him speak from
the platform of the Royal Institution.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I haven’t seen you,” said the Professor, “for years.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That must be because you haven’t looked,” said I,
“for I have both seen and heard you quite recently.
Only you were upon the platform and I was on the
ground-floor.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are too much upon the ground-floor now,” said
the Professor, with a shudder of a Southern European
at the dampness around and under foot, “and I advise
you to accept a seat in my car.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And the Baby-Bunting, trembling with excitement at
being in the company of so many highly-varnished electric
victorias and forty horse-power auto-cars, joined the
steadily-flowing stream going west.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wonder that you stoop to petrol, Professor,” I
said, as the thin, skillful hand in the baggy chamois
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>glove manipulated the driving-wheel, and the little car
snaked in and out like a torpedo-boat picking her way
between the giant warships of a Channel Squadron.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Professor’s black brows unbent under the cap-peak,
and his thin, tightly-gripped lips relaxed into a
mirthless smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, yes; you think that I should drive my car by
radio-activity, is it not? And so I could—and would,
if the pure radium chloride were not three thousand
times the price of gold. From eight tons of uranium ore
residues about one gramme—that is fifteen grains—can
be extracted by fusing the residue with carbonates of
soda, dissolving in hydrochloric acid, precipitating the
lead and other metals in solution by the aid of hydrogen-sulphide,
and separating from the chlorides that remain—polonium,
actinium, barium, and so forth—the chloride
of radium. With a single pound of this I could
not only drive an auto-car, my friend”—his olive cheek
warmed, and his melancholy dark eyes grew oddly lustrous—“I
could stop the world!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And supposing it was necessary to make it go on
again?” I suggested.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When I speak of the world,” exclaimed the Professor,
“I do not refer to the planet upon which we
revolve; I speak of the human race which inhabits it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Would the human race be obliged to you, Professor?”
I queried.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Professor turned upon me with so sudden a verbal
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">riposte</span></i> that the Baby-Bunting swerved violently.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are not as young as you were when I met you
first. To be plain, you are getting middle-aged. Do
you like it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hate it!” I answered, with beautiful sincerity.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Would you thank the man who should arrest, not
the beneficent passage of Time, which means progress,
but the wear and tear of nerve and muscle, tissue, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>bone, the slow deterioration of the blood by the microbes
of old age, for Metchnikoff has shown that there is no
difference between the atrophy of senility and the atrophy
caused by microbe poison? Would you thank him—the
man who should do that for you? Tell me, my
friend.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I replied, briefly and succinctly: “Wouldn’t I?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ha!” exclaimed the Professor, “I thought so!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I should have liked him to have begun earlier,”
I said. “Twenty-nine is a nice age, now.... It is
the age we all try to stop at, and can’t, however much
we try. Look there!”</p>

<p class='c009'>A landau limousine, dark blue, beautifully varnished,
nickel-plated, and upholstered in cream-white leather,
came gliding gracefully through the press of vehicles.
From the crest upon the panel to the sober workmanlike
livery of the chauffeur, the turn-out was perfection.
The pearl it contained was worthy of the setting.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look there?” I repeated, as the rose-cheeked, sapphire-eyed,
smiling vision passed, wrapped in a voluminous
coat of chinchilla and silver fox, with a toque of
Parma violets under the shimmer of the silken veil
that could only temper the burning glory of her wonderful
Renaissance hair.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s the exception to the rule.... There’s a
woman who doesn’t need the aid of science or of Art to
keep her at nine and twenty. There’s a woman in whom
‘the wear and tear of nerve and muscle, tissue and bone’
goes on—if it does go on—imperceptibly. Her blood
doesn’t seem to be much deteriorated by the microbe of
old age, Professor, does it? And she’s forty-three! The
alchemistical forty-three, that turns the gold of life back
into lead! The gold remains gold in her case, for that
hair, that complexion, that figure, are,” I solemnly declared,
“her own.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>At that moment Lady Clanbevan gave a smiling gracious
nod to the Professor, and he responded with a
cold, grave bow. The glow of her gorgeous hair, the
liquid sapphire of her eyes, were wasted on this stony
man of science. She passed, going home to Stanhope
Gate, I suppose, in which neighborhood she has a house;
I had barely a moment to notice the white-bonneted,
blue-cloaked nurse on the front of the landau, holding
a bundle of laces and cashmeres, and to reflect that I
have never yet seen Lady Clanbevan taking the air out
of the society of a baby, when the Professor spoke:</p>

<p class='c009'>“So Lady Clanbevan is the one woman who has no
need of the aid of Art or science to preserve her beauty
and maintain her appearance of youth? Supposing I
could prove to you otherwise, my friend, what then?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should say,” I returned, “that you had proved
what everybody else denies. Even the enemies of that
modern Ninon de l’Enclos, who has just passed——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“With the nurse and the baby?” interpolated the Professor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“With the nurse and the baby,” said I. “Even her
enemies—and they are legion—admit the genuineness
of the charms they detest. Mentioning the baby, do you
know that for twenty years I have never seen Lady
Clanbevan out without a baby? She must have quite
a regiment of children—children of all ages, sizes, and
sexes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Upon the contrary,” said the Professor, “she has
only one!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The others have all died young, then?” I asked
sympathetically, and was rendered breathless by the
rejoinder:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lady Clanbevan is a widow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“One never asks questions about the husband of a
professional beauty,” I said. “His individuality is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>merged in hers from the day upon which her latest photograph
assumes a marketable value. Are you sure there
isn’t a Lord Clanbevan alive somewhere?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is a Lord Clanbevan alive,” said the Professor
coldly. “You have just seen him, in his nurse’s
arms. He is the only child of his mother, and she has
been a widow for nearly twenty years! You do not
credit what I assert, my friend?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How can I, Professor?” I asked, turning to meet
his full face, and noticed that his dark, somewhat opaque
brown irises had lights and gleams of carbuncle-crimson
in them. “I have had Lady Clanbevan and her
progeny under my occasional observation for years. The
world grows older, if she doesn’t, and she has invariably
a baby—<em>toujours</em> a new baby—to add to the
charming illusion of young motherhood which she sustains
so well. And now you tell me that she is a twenty-years’
widow with one child, who must be nearly of
age—or it isn’t proper. You puzzle me painfully!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Would you care,” asked the Professor after a moment’s
pause, “to drive back to Harley Street with
me? I am, as you know, a vegetarian, so I will not
tax your politeness by inviting you to lunch. But I
have something in my laboratory I should wish to show
you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of all things, I should like to come,” I said. “How
many times haven’t I fished fruitlessly for an invitation
to visit the famous laboratory where nearly twenty
years ago——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I traced,” said the Professor, “the source of phenomena
which heralded the evolution of the Röntgen Ray
and the ultimate discovery of the radio-active salt they
have christened radium. I called it protium twenty
years ago, because of its various and protean qualities.
Why did I not push on—perfect the discovery and anticipate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>Sir William C—— and the X——’s? There
was a reason. You will understand it before you leave
my laboratory.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Baby-Bunting stopped at the unfashionable end
of Harley Street, in front of the dingy yellow house
with the black front door, flanked by dusty boxes of
mildewed dwarf evergreens, and the Professor, relieved
of his fur-lined coat and cap, led the way upstairs as
lightly as a boy. Two garret-rooms had been knocked
together for a laboratory. There was a tiled furnace
at the darker end of the long skylighted room thus made,
and solid wooden tables much stained with spilt chemicals,
were covered with scales, glasses, jars, and retorts—all
the tools of chemistry. From one of the many
shelves running round the walls, the Professor took down
a circular glass flask and placed it in my hands. The
flask contained a handful of decayed and moldy-looking
wheat, and a number of peculiarly offensive-looking little
beetles with tapir-like proboscides.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The perfectly developed beetle of the <em>Calandria granaria</em>,”
said the Professor, as I cheerfully resigned the
flask, “a common British weevil, whose larvæ feed upon
stored grain. Now look at this.” He reached down and
handed me a precisely similar flask, containing another
handful of grain, cleaner and sounder in appearance,
and a number of grubs, sharp-ended chrysalis-like things
buried in the grain, inert and inactive.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The larvæ of <em>Calandria granaria</em>,” said the Professor,
in his drawling monotone. “How long does it take
to hatch the beetle from the grub? you ask. Less than
a month. The perfect weevils that I have just shown
you I placed in their flask a little more than three weeks
back. The grubs you see in the flask you are holding,
and which, as you will observe by their anxiety to bury
themselves in the grain so as to avoid contact with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>light, are still immature, I placed in the glass receptacle
twenty years ago. Don’t drop the flask—I value
it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Professor!” I gasped.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Twenty years ago,” repeated the Professor, delicately
handling the venerable grubs, “I enclosed these
grubs in this flask, with sufficient grain to fully nourish
them and bring them to the perfect state. In another
flask I placed a similar number of grubs in exactly
the same quantity of wheat. Then for twenty-four
hours I exposed flask number one to the rays emanating
from what is now called radium. And as the electrons
discharged from radium are obstructed by collision with
air-atoms, I exhausted the air contained in the flask.”
He paused.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then, when the grubs in flask number two hatched
out,” I anticipated, “and the larvæ in flask number one
remained stationary, you realized——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I realized that the rays from the salt arrested growth,
and at the same time prolonged to an almost incalculable
extent,” said the Professor—“for you will understand
that the grubs in flask number one had lived
as grubs half a dozen times as long as grubs usually do....
And I said to myself that the discovery presented
an immense, a tremendous field for future development.
Suppose a young woman of, say, twenty-nine were enclosed
in a glass receptacle of sufficient bulk to contain
her, and exposed for a few hours to my protium rays,
she would retain for many years to come—until she
was a great-grandmother of ninety!—the same charming,
youthful appearance——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“As Lady Clanbevan!” I cried, as the truth rushed
upon me and I grasped the meaning this astonishing
man had intended to convey.</p>

<p class='c009'>“As Lady Clanbevan presents to-day,” said the Professor,
“thanks to the discovery of a——”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>“Of a great man,” said I, looking admiringly at the
lean worn figure in the closely-buttoned black frock-coat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I loved her.... It was a delight to her to drag
a disciple of Science at her chariot-wheels. People talked
of me as a coming man. Perhaps I was.... But I
did not thirst for distinction, honors, fame.... I
thirsted for that woman’s love.... I told her of my
discovery—as I told her everything. Bah!” His lean
nostrils worked. “You know the game that is played
when one is in earnest and the other at play. She promised
nothing, she walked delicately among the passions
she sowed and fostered in the souls of men, as a beautiful
tigress walks among the poison-plants of the jungle.
She saw that rightly used, or wrongly used, my great
discovery might save her beauty, her angelic, dazzling
beauty that had as yet but felt the first touch of Time.
She planned the whole thing, and when she said, ‘You do
not love me if you will not do this,’ I did it. I was mad
when I acceded to her wish, perhaps; but she is a woman
to drive men frenzied. You have seen how coldly,
how slightingly she looked at me when we encountered
her in the Row? I tell you—you have guessed already—I
went there to see her. I always go where she is to
be encountered, when she is in town. And she bows,
always; but her eyes are those of a stranger. Yet I
have had her on her knees to me. She cried and begged
and kissed my hands.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He knotted his thin hands, their fingers brown-tipped
with the stains of acids, and wrung and twisted them
ferociously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And so I granted what she asked, carried out the
experiment, and paid what you English call the piper.
The giant glass bulb with the rubber-valve door was
blown and finished in France. It involved an expense
of three hundred pounds. The salt I used—of protium
(christened radium now)—cost me all my savings—over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>two thousand pounds—for I had been a struggling
man——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But the experiment?” I broke in. “Good Heavens,
Professor! How could a living being remain for any
time in an exhausted receiver? Agony unspeakable, convulsions,
syncope, death! One knows what the result
would be. The merest common sense——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The merest common sense is not what one employs
to make discoveries or carry out great experiments,”
said the Professor. “I will not disclose my method; I
will only admit to you that the subject—the subjects
were insensible; that I induced <em>anæsthesia</em> by the ordinary
ether-pump apparatus, and that the strength of
the ray obtained was concentrated to such a degree that
the exposure was complete in three hours.” He looked
about him haggardly. “The experiment took place here
nineteen years ago—nineteen years ago, and it seems to
me as though it were yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And it must seem like yesterday to Lady Clanbevan—whenever
she looks in the glass,” I said. “But you
have pricked my curiosity, Professor, by the use of the
plural. Who was the other subject?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is it possible you don’t guess?” The sad, hollow
eyes questioned my face in surprise. Then they turned
haggardly away. “My friend, the other subject associated
with Lady Clanbevan in my great experiment was—Her
Baby!”</p>

<p class='c009'>I could not speak. The dowdy little grubs in the flask
became for me creatures imbued with dreadful potentialities....
The tragedy and the sublime absurdity
of the thing I realized caught at my throat, and my brain
grew dizzy with its horror.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! Professor!” I gurgled, “how—how grimly,
awfully, tragically ridiculous! To carry about with one
wherever one goes a baby that never grows older—a
baby——”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>“A baby nearly twenty years old? Yes, it is as you
say, ridiculous and horrible,” the Professor agreed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What could have induced the woman!” burst from
me.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Professor smiled bitterly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She is greedy of money. It is the only thing she
loves—except her beauty and her power over men; and
during the boy’s infancy—that word is used in the
Will—she has full enjoyment of the estate. After he
‘attains to manhood’—I quote the Will again—hers is
but a life-interest. Now you understand?”</p>

<p class='c009'>I did understand, and the daring of the woman
dazzled me. She had made the Professor doubly her
tool.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And so,” I gurgled between tears and laughter,
“Lord Clanbevan, who ought to be leaving Eton this
year to commence his first Oxford term, is being carried
about in the arms of a nurse, arrayed in the flowing
garments of a six-months’ baby! What an astonishing
conspiracy!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“His mother,” continued the Professor calmly, “allows
no one to approach him but the nurse. The family
are only too glad to ignore what they consider a deplorable
case of atavistic growth-arrest, and the boy himself——”
He broke off. “I have detained you,” he
said, after a pause. “I will not do so longer. Nor will
I offer you my hand. I am as conscious as you are—that
it has committed a crime.” And he bowed me
out with his hands sternly held behind him. There were
few more words between us, only I remember turning
on the threshold of the laboratory, where I left him, to
ask whether protium—radium, as it is now christened—checks
the growth of every organic substance? The
answer I received was curious:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly, with the exception of the nails and the
hair!”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>A week later the Professor was found dead in his
laboratory.... There were reports of suicide—hushed
up. People said he had been more eccentric than ever
of late, and theorized about brain-mischief; only I located
the trouble in the heart. A year went by, and I
had almost forgotten Lady Clanbevan—for she went
abroad after the Professor’s death—when at a little
watering-place on the Dorset coast, I saw that lovely
thing, as lovely as ever—she who was fifty if a day!
With her were the blue-cloaked elderly nurse and Lord
Clanbevan, borne, as usual, in the arms of his attendant,
or wheeled in a luxurious perambulator. Day after day
I encountered them—the lovely mother, the middle-aged
nurse, and the mysterious child—until the sight began
to get on my nerves. Had the Professor selected me
as the recipient of a secret unrivaled in the records of
biological discovery, or had he been the victim of some
maniacal delusion that cold October day when we met
in Rotten Row? One peep under the thick white lace
veil with which the baby’s face was invariably covered
would clear everything up! Oh! for a chance to allay
the pangs of curiosity!</p>

<p class='c009'>The chance came. It was a hot, waspy August forenoon.
Everybody was indoors with all the doors and
windows open, lunching upon the innutritive viands
alone procurable at health resorts—everybody but myself,
Lord Clanbevan, and his nurse. She had fallen
asleep upon a green-painted esplanade seat, gratuitously
shielded by a striped awning. Lord Clanbevan’s
C-springed, white-hooded, cane-built perambulator stood
close beside her. He was, as usual, a mass of embroidered
cambric and cashmere, and, as always, thickly
veiled, his regular breathing heaved his infant breast;
the thick white lace drapery attached to his beribboned
bonnet obscured the features upon which I so ardently
longed to gaze! It was the chance, as I have said; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>as the head of the blue-cloaked nurse dropped reassuringly
upon her breast, as she emitted the snore that
gave assurance of the soundness of her slumbers, I
stepped silently on the gravel towards the baby’s perambulator.
Three seconds, and I stood over its apparently
sleeping inmate; another, and I had lifted the veil from
the face of the mystery—and dropped it with a stifled
cry of horror!</p>

<p class='c009'>The child had a moustache!</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>“A person called to see me!” repeated the Duchess of
Rantorlie. “He pleaded urgent business, you say?”</p>

<p class='c009'>She glanced at the card presented by her groom-of-the-chambers
without taking the trouble to lift it from
the salver. “‘Mr. Moss Rubelius.’ I do not know the
name—I have no knowledge of any urgent business.
You must tell him to go away at once, and not call
again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Begging your Grace’s pardon,” remarked the official,
“the person seemed to anticipate a message of the
kind——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did he? Then,” thought her Grace, “he is not
disappointed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And, still begging your Grace’s pardon,” pursued
the discreet domestic, “he asked me to hand this second
card to your Grace.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was rather a shabby card, and dog’s-eared as though
it had been carried long in somebody’s pocket; but it
was large and feminine, and adorned with a ducal coronet
and the Duchess’s own cipher, and scribbled upon
it in pencil, in the Duchess’s own handwriting, were
two or three words, simple enough, apparently, and yet
sufficiently fraught with meaning to make their fair
reader turn very pale. She did not replace this card
upon the salver, but kept it as she said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bring the person to me at once.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And when the softly stepping servant had left the
room—one of her Grace’s private suite, charmingly furnished
as a study—she made haste to tear the card up,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>dropping the fragments into the hottest part of the
wood-fire, and thrusting at them with the poker until
the last tremulous fragment of gray ash had disappeared.
Rising from this exercise with a radiant glow
upon her usually colorless cheeks the Duchess became
aware that she was not alone. A person of vulgar appearance,
outrageously attired in a travesty of the
ordinary afternoon costume of an English gentleman,
stood three or four feet off, regarding her with an
observant and rather wily smile. Not at all discomposed,
he was the first to speak.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Before burnin’ <em>that</em>,” he remarked, in the thick,
snuffling accents of the low-bred, “your Grace ought to
have asked yourself whether it was any use. Because—I
put it to your Grace, as a poker-player, being told
the game’s fashionable in your Grace’s set—a man who
holds four aces can afford to throw away the fifth card,
even if it’s a king. And people of my profession don’t
go in for bluff. It ain’t their fancy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is your profession?” asked the Duchess, regarding
with contempt the dark, full-fed, red-lipped,
hook-beaked countenance before her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Money!” returned Mr. Moss Rubelius. He rattled
coin in his trousers-pockets as he spoke, and the superfluity
of gold manifested in large, coarse rings upon
his thick fingers, the massy chain festooned across his
broad chest, the enormous links fastening his cuffs, and
the huge diamond pin in his cravat, seemed to echo
“Money.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Duchess lost no time in coming to the point. She
was not guided by previous experience, having hitherto,
by grace as well as luck, steered clear of scandal. But,
girl of twenty as she was, she asked, as coolly as an
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">intrigante</span></i> of forty, though her young heart was fluttering
wildly against the walls of its beautiful prison,
“How did you get that card?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>“I will be quite plain with your Grace,” returned
the money-lender. “When the second lot of cavalry
drafts sailed for South Africa early in the year of 1900,
our firm, ’aving a writ of <em>’abeas</em> out against Captain
Sir Hugh Delaving of the Royal Red Dragoon Guards—I
have reason to believe your Grace knew something of
the Captain?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” said the Duchess, turning her cold blue eyes
upon the twinkling orbs of Mr. Moss Rubelius, “I knew
something of the Captain. You do not need to ask the
question. Please go on!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Captain was,” resumed Mr. Rubelius, “for a
born aristocrat, the downiest I ever see—saw, I mean.
He gave our clerks and the men with the warrant the
slip by being ’eaded up in a wooden packin’ case,
labeled ‘Officers’ Stores,’ and got away to the Cape,
where he was killed in his first engagement.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“This,” said the Duchess, “is no news to me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” said the money-lender; “but it may be news
to your Grace that, though we couldn’t lay our ‘ands
on the Captain himself, we got hold of all his luggage.
Not much there that was of any marketable value, except
a silver-gilt toilet-set. But there was a packet of letters
in a Russia writin’-case with a patent lock, all of ’em
written in the large-sized, square ’and peculiar to the
leadin’ female aristocracy, and signed ‘Ethelwyne,’ or
merely ‘E.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And this discovery procures me the pleasure of this
interview?” remarked the Duchess. “The letters are
mine—you come on the errand of a blackmailer. I have
only one thing to wonder at, and that is—why you have
not come before?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Myself and partner thought, as honorable men of
business, it would be better to approach the Captain
first,” explained the usurer. “His mother died the
week he sailed for Africa, and left him ten thousand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>pounds. We ’astened to communicate with him,
but——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But he had been killed meanwhile,” said the
Duchess. “You would have had the money he owed—or
did not owe—you, and your price for the letters,
had you reached him in time; but you did not, and
your goods are left upon your hands. Why, as honorable
men of business”—her lovely lip curled—“did you
not take them at once to the Duke?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Moss Rubelius seemed for the first time a little
nonplussed. He looked down at his large, shiny boots,
and the sight did not appear to relieve him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will be quite plain with your Grace.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pray endeavor!” said the Duchess.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The letters are—to put it delicately—not compromising
enough. They’re more,” said Mr. Rubelius, “the
letters a school-girl at Brighton would write to her
music-master, supposing him to be young and possessed
of a pair of cavalry legs and a moustache. There’s
fuel in ’em for a First-Class Connubial Row,” continued
Mr. Rubelius, “but not material for a Domestic Upheaval—followed
by an Action for Divorce. As a man,
no longer, but once in business—for within this last
month our firm has dissolved, and myself and my partner
have retired upon our means—this is my opinion
with regard to these letters in your Grace’s handwriting,
addressed to the late Captain Sir H. Delaving:
The Duke, I believe, would only laugh at ’em.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Duchess started violently, and seemed about to
speak.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, still, the letters are worth paying for,” ended
Mr. Moss Rubelius. “And your Grace can have em—at
my price.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is your price?” asked the Duchess, trying in
vain to read in the stolid physiognomy before her the
secret purpose of the soul within.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>“Perhaps your Grace wouldn’t mind my taking a
chair?” insinuated Mr. Rubelius.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do as you please, sir,” said the Duchess, “only be
brief.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll try,” said the money-lender, comfortably crossing
his legs. “To begin—we’re in the London Season
and the month of March, and your Grace has a party
at Rantorlie for the April salmon-fishing. Angling’s
my one vice—my only weakness, ever since I caught
minnows in the Regent’s Canal with a pickle-bottle tied
to a string. Coarse fishing in the Thames was my recreation
in grub times, whenever I ’ad a day away from our
office in the Minories. Trout I’ve caught now and then,
with a worm on a Stuart tackle—since I became a butterfly.
But I’ve never had a slap at a salmon, and
the finest salmon-anglin’ in the kingdom is to be ’ad
in the Haste, below Rantorlie. Ask me there for April,
see that I ’ave the pick of the sport, even if you ’ave
a Royal duke to cater for, as you ’ad last year, and,
the day I land my first twenty-pounder, the letters are
yours.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Duchess burst out laughing wildly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ha, ha! Oh!” she cried; “it is impossible to help
it.... I can’t!... It is so.... Ha, ha, ha!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shan’t disgrace you,” said Mr. Rubelius. “My
kit and turn-out will be by the best makers, and I’ll
tip the ’ead gillie fifty pound. I’m a soft-hearted hass
to let the letters go so cheap, but——Golly! the chance
of catchin’ a twenty-pound specimen of <em>Salmo salar</em> that
a Royal ’Ighness ’as angled for in vain!... Look
’ere, your Grace”—his tones were oily with entreaty—“write
me the invitation now, on the spot, and you shall
’ave back the first three of those nine letters down on
the nail.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You have them——?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“With me!” said Mr. Rubelius, producing a letter-case
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>attached to his stout person by a chain. “The
others are—say, in retirement for the present.” He
extracted from the case three large, square, gray envelopes,
their addresses penned in a large, angular,
girlish hand. “Write me the invite now,” he said, “and
these are yours to burn or show to his Grace—whichever
you please. The others shall be yours the day I
land my twenty-pounder.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Duchess moved to her writing-table and sat down.
She chose paper and a pen, and dashed off these few
lines:</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“900, <span class='sc'>Berkeley Square, W.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Mr. Moss Rubelius</span>,</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Duke and myself have asked a few friends to
join us at Rantorlie on April 1, for the salmon-fishing,
and we should be so pleased if you would come.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Sincerely yours,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>“<span class='sc'>Ethelwyne Rantorlie</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“The first letter I ever had, dated from Berkeley
Square,” commented Mr. Rubelius, as, holding the letter
very firmly down upon the blotter with her slim
and white, but very strong hands, the Duchess signed
to him with her chin to read, “that was anything in
the nature of a genial invitation.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He allowed the Duchess to take the three letters previously
referred to from his right hand, as he dexterously
twitched the invitation from the blotter with his
left finger and thumb. “This, your Grace, will be as
good as half a dozen more to me,” he observed, “when
I show it about and get a par. into the papers.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Horrible!” cried the Duchess, shuddering. “You
would not do that!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Rubelius favored her with a knowing smile as
he produced his shiny hat, his gloves, and a malacca
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>cane, gold-handled, from some remote corner in which
he had concealed them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let us, being now on the footing of ’ostess and guest,
part friendly,” he said. “Your Grace, may I take your
’and?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think the formality absolutely unnecessary,” said
the Duchess, ringing the bell.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then the money-lender went away, and she caught up
a little portrait of the Duke that stood upon her writing-table
and began to cry over it and kiss it, and say
incoherent, affectionate things, like quite an ordinary,
commonplace young wife. For, after eighteen months
of marriage, she had fallen seriously in love with her
quiet, well-bred, intellectual husband, and the remembrance
of the silly, romantic flirtation with dead Hugh
Delaving was gall and wormwood to the palate that had
learned a finer taste. How had she fallen so low as
to write those idiotic, gushing letters?</p>

<p class='c009'>Their perfume sickened her. She shuddered at the
touch of them, as she would have shuddered at the
touch of the man to whom they had been written had
he still lived. But he was dead, and she had never let
him kiss her. She was thankful to remember that, as
she put the letters in the fire and watched them blacken
and burst into flame.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c009'>“My dear Ethelwyne,” asked the Duke, “where did
you pick up Mr. Rubelius? Or, I should ask, perhaps,
how did that gentleman attain to your acquaintance?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is rather a long, dull story,” said his wife, “but
he is really an excellent person, if a little vulgar,
and—— You won’t bother me any more about him,
Rantorlie, will you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>She clasped her gloved hands about her husband’s
arm as they stood together on the river beach below
Rantorlie. The turbid flood of the Haste, tinged brown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>by spate, raced past between its rocky banks; the pine-forests
climbed to meet the mountains, and the mountains
lifted to the sky their crowns of snow. There
was a smell of spring in the air, and word of new-run
fish in the string of deep pools below the famous
Falls.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will not, if you particularly wish it,” said her
husband. “But to banish your guest from my mind—that
is impossible. For one thing, he is hung with air-belts,
bottles, and canteens, as though he were starting
for a tour in the wildest part of Norway. I believe his
equipment includes a hatchet, and I think that wad he
wears upon his shoulders is a rubber tent, but I am
not sure. He has never heard of prawn-baiting, his
rods are of the most alarming weight and size, and his
salmon-flies are as large and gaudy as paroquets, and
calculated, McDona says, to frighten any self-respecting
fish out of his senses. We can’t allow such a gorgeous
tyro to spoil the best water. He must be sent
to some of the smaller pools, with a man to look after
him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But he—he won’t be likely to catch anything there,
will he?” asked the Duchess anxiously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A seven-pounder, if he has luck!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Rantorlie, that won’t do <em>at all</em>!” cried Rantorlie’s
wife in dismay. “I want him to have the chance
of something <em>really big</em>. It’s our duty to see that our
guests are properly treated, and, though you don’t like
Mr. Rubelius——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dear child, I don’t dislike Mr. Rubelius. I simply
don’t think about him any more than I think about
the sea-lice on the new-run fish. They are there, and
they look nasty. Rubelius is here, and so does he.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Doesn’t</em> he—especially in evening-dress with a red
camelia and a turn-down collar?” gasped the Duchess.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Duke could not restrain a smile at the vision
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>evoked, as Mr. Rubelius, panoplied in india-rubber, cork,
and unshrinkables, strode into view. One of the gillies
bore his rod, the other his basket. A third followed
with that wobbliest of aquatic vehicles, a coracle,
strapped upon his back. With a grin, the man waded
into the water, unhitched his light burden, placed it
on the rapid stream, and stood, knee-deep, holding the
short painter, as the frisky coracle tugged at it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re going to try one of those things?” said the
Duke, as Rubelius gracefully lifted his waterproof helmet
to the Duchess. “You know they’re awfully
crank, don’t you, and not at all safe for a bung—I mean,
a beginner?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The men, your Grace,” explained Mr. Rubelius, “are
going to peg me down in the bed of the stream, a little
way out from the shore.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But if your peg draws,” said his host, “do you know
how to use your paddle?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That will be all right, your Grace,” said the affable
Rubelius. “I know how to punt. Often on the Thames
at Twicken’am——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear sir, the Haste in Moss-shire and the Thames
at Twickenham are two very different rivers,” said the
Duke, beckoning his gillies to follow, and turning away.
“I hope the man may not come to any harm,” he said.
“Ethelwyne, will you walk down to the Falls with me?
I”—he reddened a little—“I sent the others on in carts
by road. We see so little of each other these days.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And the young couple started, leaving Mr. Rubelius to
be put into his coracle, with much splashing, and swearing
on his part, by two of the gillies and a volunteer.
It was a mild day for April in the North. A single
cuckoo called by the riverside, and the Duke and Duchess
did not hurry, though Ethelwyne turned back
before she reached the Falls, below which the deepest
salmon-pools were situated, and where the men, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>boats, and the rest of the party waited. She had her
rod and gillie, and meant to spin a little desultorily
from the bank, the Haste being almost in every part
too deep for waders, except in the upper reaches.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wonder how that horror is getting on?” she
thought, as the gillie baited her prawn-tackle. Then,
stepping out upon a natural pier of rough stones leading
well out into the turbulent whitey-brown stream,
the Duchess skilfully swung out her line, and, after a
little manipulation, found herself fast in a good-sized
fish.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What weight should you judge it?” she asked the
attendant, when the silvery prey had been gaffed and
landed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“All saxteen,” said the gillie briefly. “Hech! What
cry was that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>As the man held up his hand the noise was repeated.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It sounds like somebody shouting ‘Help!’” said the
Duchess.</p>

<p class='c009'>And, rod in hand, she ran out upon the pier of
bowlders, and, shading her eyes with her hand, gazed upstream,
as round a rocky point above came something
like a tarred washing-basket with a human figure huddled
knees-to-chin inside. The coracle had betrayed the
confidence of Mr. Rubelius, and drifted with its hapless
tenant down the mile and a half of racing water
which lay between Rantorlie and the Falls. The Falls!
At that remembrance the laughter died upon the Duchess’s
lips, and the ridiculous figure drifting towards
her in the bobbing coracle became upon an instant a
tragic spectacle. For Death waited for Mr. Rubelius
a little below the next bend in the rocky bed of the
Haste. And—if the money-lender were drowned—those
letters ... yes, those letters, the proofs of the Duchess’s
folly, might be regained and destroyed, secretly,
and nobody would ever——</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>It seemed an age of reflection, but really only a second
or two went by before the Duchess cried out to
Rubelius in her sweet, shrill voice, and ran out to the
very end of the pier of rocks, and with a clever underhand
jerk sent the heavy prawn-tackle spinning out
up and down the river. Once she tried—and failed.
The second time, two of the three hooks stuck firmly
into the wickerwork of the coracle. It spun round, suddenly
arrested in its course, but the strong salmon-gut
held, and, after an anxious minute or two, the livid
Rubelius safely reached shore.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve ’ad my lesson,” said he, as the gillie administered
whisky. “Never any more salmon-fishing for me!
It’s too tryin’,” he gulped—“too ’ard upon the nerves
of a man not born to it!” Then he got up, and came
bare-headed to the Duchess. His face was very pale
and flabby, and his thick lips had lost their color, as
he held out a black leather notecase to her Grace. “You—you
saved my life,” he said, “and I’m not going to
be ungrateful. Here they are—the six letters. Look
’em over, if you like, and see for yourself. And, my
obliged thanks to his Grace for his hospitality—but
I leave for town to-morrow. Good-by, your Grace. You
won’t hear of me again!” And Mr. Rubelius kept his
word.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>THE CHILD</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>He arrived late—long after the ship of his father’s
fortune had been safely tugged into dock—announcing
his entrance upon this terrestrial stage at a moment
when people had ceased to expect him. I may say that
Tom and Leila, having spent twelve years of married
life in the propagation of theories alone, had the most
definite notions upon the subject of infant rearing, training,
culture, and so forth. Leila intended, she informed
me in confidence, to be “an advanced mother,” and
Tom, as father to the child of an advanced mother,
could hardly help turning out an advanced father, even
had he not cherished ambitions in that line.</p>

<p class='c009'>The boy—for, as Tom reassured all sympathetic callers
during the high-pressure first week of its existence,
it undoubtedly was a boy—seemed on first sight rather
smaller and spottier than the child of so many brilliant
prospects had any right to be. They gave him
the name of Harold, a clanking procession of other
names coupled on to it, ending in Alexander Eric. And
they engaged and imported a professional Child Culturist,
Miss Sallie Cooter, of Washington—pronounced
Wawshington—certified teacher, trained nurse, member
of the Ethnophysiological Society of America, and one
doesn’t know how many others, to rear Harold on the
very latest scientific plan. Miss Cooter, as the intimate
friend and chosen disciple of the Inventress of the System
at which Tom and Leila had taken fire (a lady of
literary talents and original views, who had brought up,
on purely hygienic principles, a family of one, and expanded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>it into a multiplicity of chapters)—Miss Cooter
might be trusted to achieve the desired result, and turn
out Harold, physically and mentally, a prodigy of infantile
perfection. Her work was purely philanthropic,
and if she consented to accept the inadequate salary
of two hundred a year in return for her services, Leila
and Tom explained, she must in no sense be treated as
a hireling.</p>

<p class='c009'>The united efforts of the brougham and the spring-cart
fetched Miss Cooter and a mountain of Saratogas
from the station one spring day, and she came down
to afternoon tea in the very newest of Parisian tea-gowns,
which, properly speaking, is not a tea-gown at
all. She was decidedly pretty, being dark, slim, bright-eyed,
keen-featured, and almost painfully intelligent-looking,
even without her gold-framed pince-nez. We
devoted the evening to sociality, as Harold’s regimen of
mental and physical culture was to commence upon
the following day.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you shall have a little peep at Baby,” Leila said,
“when we go up to dress for dinner.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Cooter agreed. “But I guess I’ve got to ask
you, since the boy’s name is Har’ld, to call him by it,
and no other,” she said. “Our society is dead against
abbreviations and pet names. We hold that they act as
a clog upon the expanding faculties of the child, and
arrest mental progress. Besides, when maturity is
reached, how pyfectly absurd it is to hear middle-aged
men and women addressed as ‘Toto’ and ‘Tiny’!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Tom, who has a way of calling Leila “Mouse” when in
good humor, turned rich imperial purple at this home-thrust,
and Leila, whose pet name for Tom is “Tumps,”
called attention to the green-fly on the pot-roses, both
silently registering a vow never again, save <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in camera</span></i>,
to use the offending appellations.</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Cooter was formally invested with Harold on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>the following morning. His ex-nurse, a plump, rosy-cheeked
country-woman, painfully devoid of culture, and
absolutely unskilled in the repression of emotion, was
relegated, in floods of tears, to command of the laundry.
Leila, compassionating the grief of the exile, would
have pleaded for Mary’s reduction to the post of under-nurse;
but Miss Cooter pronounced that Mary was
an obstacle in the way of Progress, and an enemy to
Culture, and must go.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mary went, and Harold, at first too stunned by her
desertion to yield to sorrow, presently proclaimed his
bereavement in a succession of ear-piercing shrieks.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is to be done?” queried Leila, by signs.</p>

<p class='c009'>Applying both hands to his mouth, after the fashion
of a speaking-trumpet, Tom vocalized the suggestion,
“Send—for Mary—back!”</p>

<p class='c009'>But Miss Cooter sternly shook her head, and, bending
over the cradle which contained Harold, looked sternly
in his flushed and disfigured countenance. He immediately
held his breath, growing from crimson to purple
and from purple to black as she delivered her inaugural
address.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear Har’ld,” said she, with crisp distinctness,
“you are a vurry little boy——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hear, hear!” I interpolated, and got a frown from
Leila.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And at three months old your reasoning fahculties
are not developed enough for you to comprehend that
what you don’t like may be the best thing for you.
Mary has gone, and Mary will not come back. Henceforth
you are in my cayah, and you will find me fyum,
but gentle. However badly you may act, I shall not
punish you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Harold hiccoughed and stared up at the bright, intellectual
face above him with round, astonished eyes
and open, dribbling mouth.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>“Your own sense of what is right and what is wrawng,
dormant though it be at this vurry moment, I intend to
awaken and——”</p>

<p class='c009'>Harold, never before in his brief life harangued after
this fashion, appeared to grasp already the idea that
something was wrong. The expression of astonishment
faded, his down-drooped mouth assumed the bell or
trumpet-shape, and, rapidly doubling and undoubling
himself with mechanical regularity, he emitted the most
astonishing series of sounds we had yet heard from him.
No caresses were administered for the assuagement of
his woe, no broken English babbled in his infant ears.
The Rules of the System of Child Culture absolutely
prohibited petting, and baby-language was denounced
by Miss Cooter as “pynicious.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As she predicted, Harold left off howling after a certain
interval.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now I guess you have lyned one lesson already!”
said Miss Cooter. “When you are older, Har’ld, you
will cawmprehend that the truest kindness on your
payrents’ part praumpted the separation that has given
you pain. You will have your bottle now; you will say
‘Thank you’ for it, and ahfter consuming the contents,
you will go quietly to sleep.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But it took a long time to convince the dubious Harold
that the trumpet-shaped, nickel-silver-stoppered vessel
tendered by his new guardian was the equivalent of
his beloved and familiar “Maw.” When finally convinced,
he grabbed it without the slightest attempt at
saying “Thank you,” and, with the gloomiest scowl that
I have ever beheld upon a countenance of such pulpy
immaturity, applied himself to deglutition. Miss Cooter
shook her head discouragingly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This child has a strawngly developed animal nature,”
pronounced she—“a throwback to the primeval
savage, I should opine.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>“Delightful! Do buy him a little stone ax and a
baby bearskin, Leila,” I pleaded. “Think what light
he will throw upon the Tertiary Period—if Miss Cooter
happens to be right!”</p>

<p class='c009'>But Miss Cooter shook her head. “He must be environed
by softening and civilizing influences,” said she,
“from this vurry moment. Vegetarian diet is what I
should strawngly recommend.” Her eye doubtfully
questioned the rapidly sinking level of the sterilized milk
in Harold’s glass trumpet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is such a thing as a cow-tree, isn’t there?”
said Leila anxiously. “Perhaps Cope might acclimatize
one in the tropical house?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But while the cow-tree is being acclimatized,” I
asked disturbingly, “upon what is Harold to live?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Kindly take this,” said Miss Cooter. “May I trouble
you? Please!” she repeated sternly. But Harold only
screwed up his eyes and dug his pinky fists into them as
his monitress took the empty trumpet away, telling us
stories of an atypical and highly-cultured boy baby of
her acquaintance who not only exhibited Chesterfieldian
politeness at four months of age, saying “Please” and
“Thank you,” and “Kindly pass the salt,” but regularly
performed its own ablutions, went through breathing
exercises and simple gymnastics, was familiar with
the use of the abacus, and could work out sums in
simple addition upon a patent hygienic slate. All
these facts Miss Cooter put before us with convincing
eloquence. Her language was well chosen, her scientific
knowledge and technical skill quite appalling.
There was nothing about a baby that she did not understand,
except, perhaps—the baby.</p>

<p class='c009'>From that day Harold lived under the microscope.
Charts of his temper, as of his temperature, were regularly
kept up to date; and his progress, physical and
psychological, was recorded by Miss Cooter in a kind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>of ship’s log-book, in which data of meteorological disturbances
appeared with distressing frequency. He was
not precocious enough to be classified as abnormal, or
sufficiently original to come under the heading “Atypical,”
or old enough to tell lies, and so be dubbed imaginative.
But that tertiary ancestor from whom, according
to Miss Cooter, he derived his temperament,
must have possessed some strength of character, for
from the beginning to the end, Harold’s strongest prejudice
was manifested towards Miss Cooter, his most violent
attachment in the direction of the banished Mary,
for whom he howled at regular intervals until he forgot
her, when he became reserved, distrustful, and apathetic.
His intellectual qualities were not of the kind
that responded to scientific forcing. He never learned
that an orange was a sphere, or a rusk an irregular cube.
The india-rubber letters and object-blocks possessed for
him no meaning; the colored balls of the abacus only
awakened in him a tepid interest. He was in texture
flabby, and habitually wore an expression of languid
indifference—intensified when Miss Cooter was delivering
one of her oral lectures, to utter boredom. Despite
his sanitary surroundings, his day-nursery, intermediate
nursery, and night-nursery, papered, carpeted, furnished,
lighted, ventilated, and warmed upon the most
approved scientific methods, he did not thrive, contracting
complaints incidental to infancy with passionate
enthusiasm, and keeping them long after another child
would have done with them. And then he complicated
an unusually violent attack of croup with convulsions,
and Miss Cooter guessed she had better resign the case,
which she did “right away,” in favor of some atypical,
imaginative, non-atavistic young American citizen.
When last I looked into the hygienic day-nursery, most
of the educational objects it had contained had vanished—presumably
into cupboards—and Harold was lying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>in the cotton lap of his recovered Mary, nursing a
stuffed kitten, and sucking an attenuated thumb. The
expression of gloomy boredom had vanished from his
countenance as Mary chanted a rhyme, deplorably lacking
in sense and construction, about a certain Baby
Bunting whose father went a-hunting to get a little
rabbit-skin to wrap the Baby Bunting in. It afforded
Harold such undisguised delight that I felt sure the
rabbit must have burrowed in tertiary strata, and that
the predatory parents of Baby Bunting must have been
the primal type from which Harold hailed. But Miss
Cooter, who could alone have sympathized with my scientific
delight in this discovery, was tossing in mid-Atlantic
on her way to the land of the Stars and Stripes.</p>

<p class='c009'>We were, however, to meet yet once again under the
spangled folds of Old Glory. It was a year or so later,
on board a Hudson River steamboat. She was prettier
than ever, quite beautifully dressed, and her <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entourage</span></i>
comprised two nurses (a colored “mammy” and a pretty
Swiss), a perambulator with a baby, and a husband.
She introduced me to the husband and the baby, a
round, rosy baby, neither atypical nor atavistic, but just
of the common, old-fashioned kind.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Isn’t he cute!” she exclaimed, with rapture. “Smile
at Momma, Baby, and show um’s pretty toofs!” Then
she addressed the child as a “doodleum ducksey,” while
I stood speechless and staring.</p>

<p class='c009'>My circular gaze awakened memories of the past. She
asked after Harold.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He is very well—now!” I said with point. “May
I be pardoned for remarking that you do not appear to
be rearing your own baby upon the System of Child
Culture you formerly followed with such extraordinary
success?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” said the late Miss Cooter thoughtfully.
“No-o!”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>“Why not?” I asked, hot with the remembrance of
Harold’s sufferings.</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Cooter considered, a beautifully manicured forefinger
in a dimple that I had never observed before.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why not? You earnestly advocated the system—for
other people’s babies.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” said the late Miss Cooter, with a burst of
candor, “I reckon because those <em>were</em> other people’s
babies. This is mine!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c005'>A HINDERED HONEYMOON</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The coffee and liquor stage of a long and elaborate
luncheon having been reached, the rubicund and puffy
personage occupying the chair at the head of the table—number
three against the glass partition, east end, Savoy
Grill-room—waved a stout hand, and instantly eight
of the nimblest waiters—two to a double-leaved folding-screen—closed
in upon the table with these aids to
privacy. The rubicund personage, attired, like each of
his male guests present, in the elaborate frock-coat, with
white buttonhole bouquet, tender-hued necktie, pale-complexioned
waistcoat, gray trousers, and shiny patent
leathers inseparable from a wedding—the rubicund personage
(who was no less a personage than Mr. Otto
Funkstein, managing head of the West End Theatre
Syndicate) got upon his legs, champagne-glass in hand,
and proposed the united healths of Lord and Lady
Rustleton.</p>

<p class='c009'>“For de highly-brivileged nopleman who hos dis day
gonferred ubon de brightest oond lofliest ornamend of
de London sdage a disdinguished name oond an ancient
didle I hof noding put gongradulations,” said Mr. Funkstein,
balancing himself upon the tips of his patent-leather
toes, and thrusting his left hand (hairy and
adorned with rings of price) in between the jeweled
buttons of his large, double-breasted buff waistcoat.
“For de sdage oond de pooblic dot will lose de most
prilliant star dot has efer dwinkled on de sdage of de
West Enf Deatre I hof nodings poot gommiseration.
As de manacher of dot blayhouse I feel vit de pooblic.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>As de friend—am I bermitted to say de lofing oond
baternal friend of de late Miss Betsie le Boyntz?”—(tumultuous
applause checked the current of the speaker’s
eloquence)—“changed poot dis day in de dwingling
of an eye—in de hooding of a modor-horn—by de machick
of a simble ceremony at de Registrar’s—gonverted
from a yoong kirl in de first dender ploom”—(deafening
bravos hailed this flight of poetic imagination)—“de
first dender ploom of peauty oond de early brime
of chenius”—(the lady-guests produced their handkerchiefs)—“into
a yoong vife, desdined ere long to wear
upon her lofely prow de goronet of an English Gountess”—(Otto
began to weep freely)—“a Gountess of
Pomphrey.... Potztauzend! de dears dey choke me.
Mine dear vriends, I gannot go on.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Everybody patted Funkstein upon the back at once.
Everybody uttered something consoling at an identical
moment. Mopping his streaming features with the largest
white cambric handkerchief ever seen, the manager
was about to resume, when Lord Rustleton—whose tragic
demeanor at the Registrar’s Office had created a
subdued sensation among the officials there, whose deep
depression during the wedding banquet had been intensified
rather than alleviated by frequent bumpers of
champagne, and who had gradually collapsed in his
chair during Funkstein’s address until little save his
hair and features remained above the level of the tablecloth,
galvanically rose and, with a soft attempt to thump
the table, cried: “Order!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Choke him off,” murmured a smart comedian to his
neighbor, “for pity’s sake. He’s going to tell us how
he threw over the swell girl he was engaged to a month
before their wedding—for Petsie’s sake; and how he has
brought his parents’ gray hairs with sorrow to the grave,
and for ever forfeited the right to call himself an English
gentleman. I know, bless you! I had it all from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>him last night at the Mummers’ Club, and this morning
at his rooms in Wigmore Street.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Rustleton!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Order!” yelled Rustleton again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Order!” echoed Funkstein, turning a circular pair
of rather bibulous and bloodshot blue eyes upon the
protestant bridegroom. “Oond vy order?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Permimme to reminyou,” said Rustleton, with laborious
distinctness, “that the present Head of my fammary,
the Rironaurable the Earl of Pomphrey—in poinnofac’,
my Fara—is at the present momen’ of speaking
in the enjoymen’ of exhallent health, an’ nowistanning
present painfully strained rela’ions essisting bi’ween us,
I have no desire—nor, I feel convinned, has my wife,
Lady Rustleton, any desire—to, in poinnofac’, usurp
his shoes, or play leapfrog over his—in poinnofac’, his
coffin. Therefore, the referen’ of the distinnwished gelleman
who, in poinnofac’, holds the floor, to the coronet
of a Countess in premature conneshion with the brow
of my newly-marriwife I am compelled to regard as absorrutely
ram bad form!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tam bad <em>vat</em>?” shrieked Funkstein.</p>

<p class='c009'>Rustleton leaned over the table. His eyes were set in
a leaden-hued countenance. His hair hung lankly over
his damp forehead. He nerved himself for a supreme
effort. “Ununerrarrably ram baform!” he said, and
with this polysyllabic utterance fell into a crystal dish
of melted ice, and a comatose condition.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bad, bad boy!” said the recently-made Lady Rustleton,
biting her notorious cherry underlip, and darting a
brilliant glance at Funkstein out of her celebrated eyes
as Rustleton was snatched from his perilous position
by a strong-armed chorus beauty; and the low comedian,
who had become famous since the production of <cite>The
Charity Girl</cite>, dried the Viscount’s head with a table-napkin
and propped him firmly in his chair.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>“It is not de Boy, but de man dat drinks it,” giggled
Funkstein, with recovered good temper. “Ach ja, oond
also de voman. How many bints hof I not seen
you....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’ll do, thanks,” said the newly-made Viscountess,
with her well-known expression of prim propriety.
“Not so much reminiscing, you know; it’s what poor
Tonnie called ‘ahem’d bad form’ just now, didn’t you,
ducky?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t call me rucky,” said the gentleman addressed,
who was now rapidly lapsing into the lachrymose stage
of his complaint. “Call me a mirerrable worm or a
‘fernal villain. I reserve both names. Doesn’ a man
who has alienarid the affeshuns of his father, blirid his
mother’s fonnest hopes, and broken his pli’rid word to
a fonnanloving woman—girl, by Jingo——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, do dry up about that now, darling!” said Lady
Rustleton tartly. “I dare say she deserved what she
got. What you have to remember now is that you’re
married to me, and we shall be spinning away in the
Liverpool Express in another hour, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</span></i> for the
ocean wave. I always <em>said</em>, when I <em>did</em> have a honeymoon—a
real one—I’d have it on the opening week of
the production on a big Atlantic liner. And this is the
trial voyage of the <em>Regent Street</em>, and she’s the biggest
thing in ships afloat to-day. Do let’s drink her health!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The toast was drunk with enthusiasm. Two waiters
advanced bearing a wedding-cake upon a charger. The
bride coyly cut a segment from the mass. It was divided
and passed round. The ladies took pieces to dream on,
the men shied at the indigestible morsels. Somebody had
the bright idea of sending a lump to the chauffeur of the
bridal motor-car, which had been waiting in the bright
October sunshine, outside in the palm-adorned courtyard,
since one o’clock. A <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chassé</span></i> of cognac went round.
Rustleton was shaken into consciousness of his marital
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>responsibilities and a fur-lined overcoat; everybody kissed
Petsie; all the women cried, Petsie included—but not unbecomingly.
Her bridal gown, a walking-costume of
white cloth trimmed with silver braid, contained a thoroughly
contented young woman; her hat, a fascinating
creation, trimmed with a rose-colored bird, a <em>marquisette</em>,
and a real lace veil, crowned a completely happy
wife. Tonnie possessed nothing extraordinary in the
way of good looks or good brains, it was true; but Tonnie’s
wife was wealthy in these physical attributes. He
possessed a high-nosed, aristocratic old fossil of a father,
whose prejudices against a daughter-in-law taken from
the lyric boards must be got over. He owned a perfectly
awful mother, whose ancestral pride and whose
three chins must—nay, should—be leveled with the dust.
His sisters, the Ladies Pope-Baggotte, Petsie said to herself
with a smile, were foewomen unworthy of such steel
as is forged in the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coulisses</span></i> of the musical comedy theaters.
Yet should they, too, bite the dust. In a golden
halo—partly hope, partly champagne—she saw Lady
Rustleton sweeping, attired in electrifying gowns, onwards
to the conquest of Society. The greengrocer’s
shop in Camberwell, among whose cabbages and potatoes
her infancy had been passed; the Board-School,
on whose benches the first-fruits of knowledge had been
garnered, were quite forgotten. Some other little circumstances
connected with the Past were blotted from
the slate of memory by the perfumed sponge of gratified
ambition. She bore the deluge of rice and confetti with
dazzling equanimity. She hummed “Buzzy, Buzzy,
Busy Bee” as the motor-car, its chauffeur sorely embarrassed
by a giant wedding favor, a pair of elderly
slippers tied on the rear-axle, sped to Euston.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve got there at last,” said Petsie, as the Express
ran into the Liverpool docks and toiling human ants
began to climb up the ship’s gangways thrust downwards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>from the beetling gray sides of the biggest of all
modern liners. “I’ve got there at last, I have, and in
spite of Billy Boman. A precious little silly I must
have been to take a hairdresser for a swell; but at seventeen
what girl brought up in a Camberwell backstreet
knows a paste solitaire from a real diamond, or a
ready-made suit, bought for thirty bob at a Universal
Supply Stores, from a Bond Street one? And if nice
curly hair and a straight nose, a clear skin, and a good
figure were all that’s wanted to make a gentleman, Billy
could have sported himself along with the best. But
now he’s dead, and I’ve married again into the Peerage,
and I shall sit on the Captain’s right at the center saloon
table, not only as the prettiest woman on board his
big new ship, but as a bride and a Viscountess into the
bargain. Wake up, Tonnie dear. You’ve slept all the
way from Euston, and there’s a plank to climb.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Eh?” Tonnie stared with glassy eyes at the scurrying
crowds of human figures, the piled-up trucks of
giant trunks and dress-baskets soaring aloft at the end
of donkey-engine cables, to vanish into the bowels of
the marine leviathan. “Eh! What! Hang it! How
confoundedly my head aches! Funkstein must have
given us a brutally unwholesome luncheon. Why did
I allow him to entertain us? I felt from the first it
was a hideous mistake.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why did you let the fellows persuade you to drink
more of the Boy than is good for you, you soft-headed
old darling?” Petsie gurgled. She smoothed the lank
hair of her new-made spouse, and, reaching down his hat
from the netting, crowned him with it, and bounded out
of the reserved first-class compartment like a lively little
rubber ball. “Here’s Timms, your man, with my
new maid. No, thank you, Simpkins. You can take the
traveling-bags. I may be a woman of title, but I mean
to carry my jewel-case myself. Come along into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>Ark, Tonnie, with the other couples. What number did
you say belonged to our cabin, darling?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Gobelin Tapestry Bridal Suite Number Four,”
said Rustleton, with a pallid smile, as a white-capped,
gold-banded official hurried forward to relieve the Viscountess
of her coroneted jewel-case.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How tweedlums!” sighed Petsie, retaining firm hold
of the leather repository of her brand-new diamond tiara
and necklace, not to mention all the rings and brooches
and bangles reaped from the admiring occupants of the
orchestra-stalls at the West End Theatre during the
tumultuously successful run of <cite>The Charity Girl</cite>.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It costs for the trip—five days, four hours, and sixteen
minutes—between Queenstown and the Daunts Rock
Lightship,” said Rustleton, with a heavy groan, “exactly
two hundred and seventy-five guineas. Ha, ha!”
He laughed hollowly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But why did you choose such a screamingly swell
suite, you wicked, wasteful duckums?” cried the bride
coquettishly, as their guide switched on the electric light
and revealed a chaste and sumptuous nest of apartments
in carved and inlaid mahogany, finished in white enamel
with artistic touches of gold, and hung with tapestry of
a greeny-blue and livid flesh-color.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because I can’t afford it,” said the dismal bridegroom,
“and because the meals and all that will be
served here separately and privately.” He sank limply
upon a sumptuous lounge, and hurled an extinct cigarette-end
into an open fireplace surrounded by beaten
brass and crowned by a mantel in rose-colored marble.
“The execrable ordeal of the first cabin dining-room,
with its crowds of gross, commonplace, high-spirited,
hungry feeders will thus be spared us. You need never
set foot in the Ladies’ Drawing-room; the Lounge and
the Smoking-room shall equally be shunned by me. Exercise
on the Promenade Deck is a necessity. We shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>take it daily, and take it together, my <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">incognito</span></i> preserved
by a motor-cap and goggles, your privacy ensured
by a silk—two silk—veils.” He smiled wanly. “I have
roughly laid down these lines, formulated this plan, for
the maintenance of our privacy without making any allowance
for the exigencies of the weather and the condition
of the sea. But if I should be prostrated—and I
am an exceedingly bad sailor at the best of times—remember,
dearest, that a tumbler of hot water administered
every ten minutes, alternately with a slice of iced
lemon, should feverish symptoms intervene, is not a
panacea, but an alleviation, as my cousin, Hambridge
Ost, would say. I rather wonder what Hambridge is
saying now. He possesses an extraordinary faculty of
being scathingly sarcastic at the expense of persons who
deserve censure. An unpleasant sensation in my spine
gives me the impression—do you ever have those impressions?—that
he is exercising that faculty now—and at
my expense. Timms, I will ask you to unpack my dressing-gown
and papooshes, and then, if you, my darling,
do not object, I will lie down comfortably in my own
room and have a cup of tea. If I might make a suggestion,
dearest, it is that you would tell your maid to get
out <em>your</em> dressing-gown and <em>your</em> slippers, and lie down
comfortably in <em>your</em> own room and have a cup of tea.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The twenty-six thousand ton Atlantic flyer moved
gracefully down the Mersey, the last flutter of handkerchiefs
died away on the stage, the last head was pulled
back over the vessel’s rail, the seething tumult of settling
down reduced itself to a hive-like buzzing. The
<em>Regent Street’s</em> passenger-list comprised quite a number
of notabilities connected with Art and the Drama, a
promising crop of American millionaires, an ex-Viceroy
of India, and a singularly gifted orang-utan, the biggest
sensation of the London season, who had dined with the
Lord Mayor and Corporation at the Mansion House,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>and was now crossing the ocean to fulfill a roof-garden
engagement in New York, and be entertained at a freak
supper by six of the supreme leaders of American Society.
Petsie pondered the passenger-list with a pouting
lip. She heard from her enraptured maid of the glories
of the floating palace in which the first week of her
honeymoon was to be spent as she sipped the cup of tea
recommended by Rustleton.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lifts to take you up and down stairs, silver-gilt and
enamel souvenirs given to everybody free, Turkish baths,
needle baths, electric baths, hairdressing and manicuring
saloons, millinery establishments, a theater with a stock
company who don’t know what sea-sickness means, jewelers’
shops, florists, and Fuller’s, a palmist, and a
thought-reader. Goodness! the gay old ship must be a
floating London, with fish and things squattering about
underneath one’s shoe-heels instead of ‘phone-wires and
electric-light cables. And I’m shut up like a blooming
pearl in an oyster, instead of running about and looking
at everything. Oh, Simpkie’—Simpkins, the new maid,
had been a dresser at the West End Theatre—“I’m dying
for the chance of a little flutter on my own, and how
am I to get it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The <em>Regent Street</em> gave a long, stately, sliding dive
forwards as a mammoth roller of St. George’s Channel
swept under her sky-scraping stern. A long, plaintive
moan—forerunner of how many to come!—sounded from
the other side of the partition dividing the apartments
of the bride from that of her newly-wedded lord.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think you’re goin’ to get it, my lady,” said the
demure Simpkins, as Rustleton’s man knocked at his
mistress’s door to convey the intimation that his lordship
preferred not to dine.</p>

<p class='c009'>A head-wind and a heavy sea combined, during the
next three days of the voyage, to render Rustleton a prey
to agonies which are better imagined than described.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>While he imbibed hot water and nibbled captain’s biscuits,
or lay prone and semi-conscious in the clutches of
the hideous malady of the wave, Lady Rustleton, bright-eyed,
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petite</span></i>, and beautifully dressed, paraded the promenade
deck with a tail of male and female cronies, played
at quoits and croquet, to the delight of select audiences,
and sat in sheltered corners after dinner, well out of
the radius of the electric light, sometimes with two or
three, generally with one, of the best-looking victims of
her bow and spear. She sat on the Captain’s right hand
at the center table, outrageously bedecked with diamonds.
She played in a musical sketch and sang at a
charity concert. “Buzzy, Buzzy, Busy Bee” was thenceforth
to be heard in every corner of the vast maritime
hotel that was hurrying its guests Westward at the utmost
speed of steel and steam. Fresh bouquets of Malmaison
carnations, roses and violets from the Piccadilly
florists, were continually heaped upon her shrine, dainty
jeweled miniature representations of the <em>Regent Street’s</em>
house-flag, boxes of choice bonbons showered upon her
like rain. The celebrated orang-utan occupied the chair
next hers at a special banquet, the newest modes in millinery
found their way mysteriously to her apartment,
if she had but tried them on, smiled, and, with the inimitable
Petsie wink at the reflection of her own provokingly
pretty features in the shop mirror, approved.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I keep forgetting I’m a married woman,” she would
say, with the Petsie smile, when elderly ladies of the
cat-like type, and middle-aged men who were malicious,
inquired after the health of the invisible Lord Rustleton.
“But he’s there, poor dear; or as much as is left
of him. Quite contented if he gets his milk and beef-juice,
and the hot water comes regularly, and there’s a
slice of lemon to suck. No; I’m afraid I can’t give him
your kind message of sympathy, you know, because sympathy
is too disturbing, he says.... He doesn’t even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>like <em>me</em> to ask him if he’s feeling bad, because, as he tells
me, I have only to look at him to know that he is, poor
darling.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus prattled the bride, even ready to <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">faire l’ingénue</span></i>
for the benefit of even an audience of one. The voyage
agreed with Petsie. Her complexion, dulled by make-up,
assumed a healthier tint; her eyes and smile grew
brighter, even as the ruddy gold faded from her abundant
hair. The end of this story would have been completely
different had not the tricksy sea-air brought
about this deplorable change.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m getting dreadfully rusty, as you say, Simpkie;
and if the man in the hairdresser’s shop on the Promenade
Deck Arcade can give me a shampoodle and touch
me up a bit—quite an artist is he, and quite the gentleman?
Oh, very well, I’ll look in on my gentleman-artist
between breakfast and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bouillon</span></i>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Petsie did look in. The artist’s studio, elegantly hung
with heavy pink plush curtains, only contained, besides
a shampooing-basin, a large mirror, a nickel-silver instrument
of a type between a chimney-cowl and a ship’s
ventilator, and a client’s chair, a young person of ingratiating
manners, who offered Lady Rustleton the
chair, and enveloping her dainty person in a starchy
pink wrapper, touched a bell, and saying, “The operator
will attend immediately, moddam,” glided noiselessly
away. Petsie, approvingly surveying her image in the
mirror, did not hear a male footstep behind her. But
as the head and shoulders of the operator rose above the
level of her topmost waves, and his reflected gaze encountered
her own, she became ghastly pale beneath her
rose-bloom, and with a little choking cry of recognition
gasped out:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bill ... Boman! ... it can’t be you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The old identical same,” Mr. William Boman said,
with a cheerful smile. “And if the shock has made you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>giddy, I can turn on the basin-hose in half a tick, and
give you a splash of cold as a reviver. Will you have
it? No? Then don’t faint, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You wrote to say you were dying at Dieppe five
years ago,” sobbed Petsie, into the folds of the pink
calico wrapper. “You wicked, cruel man, you know you
did!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And now you’re crying because I didn’t die,” said
Mr. Boman, arranging his sable forehead-curls in the
glass, and complacently twirling a highly-waxed mustache.
“No pleasing you women. You never know what
you want, strikes me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But somebody sent me a French undertaker’s bill for
a first-class funeral, nearly thirty pounds it came to
when we’d got the francs down to sovereigns,” moaned
Petsie, “and I paid it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That was my little dodge,” said Mr. Boman calmly,
“to get a few yellow-birds to go on with. Trouble I’d
got into—don’t say any more about it, because I am a
reformed character now. And now we’re talking about
characters, what price yours, my Lady Rustleton?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Billy!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bigamy ain’t a pretty word, but that’s what it comes
to, as I’ve said to myself many an evening as I smoked
my cigar on the second-class deck promenade, and heard
you singing away in there to the swells in the music-room
like a—like a cage full of canaries. I shan’t make
no scene nor nothing like that, says I. Her hair’s getting
a bit off color—see it by daylight, she’ll have to
come my way before long, and then I shall tip her the
ghost with a vengeance.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Bill dear, how could you be so cruel!” pleaded
Petsie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not so much of the ‘Bill dear,’ I’ll trouble you,”
said Mr. Boman sternly. “Why don’t you produce that
aristocratic corpse you’ve married, and let me have it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>out with him? Seasick, is he? I’ll make him land-sick
before I’ve done with him, and so I tell you. He’ll have
to sell some of his blooming acres to satisfy me, or some
of them diamonds of yours, my lady.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But at this juncture the delayed attack of hysteria
swooped upon its victim. Summoning his young lady-assistant,
Mr. Boman, with a few injunctions, placed the
patient in her care. Then brushing a few bronze-hued
hairs from his frock-coat, removing his dapper apron,
and tidying his hair with a rapid application of the
brush, he winked as one well pleased, and betook himself
to Gobelin Tapestry Bridal Suite Number Four, in
the character of a Messenger of Fate.</p>

<p class='c009'>Three hours later the news had leaked out all over
the <em>Regent Street</em>. The great vessel buzzed like a wasps’-nest,
and the utmost resources of wireless telegraphy
were taxed to communicate to sister ships upon the
ocean and fellow-men upon the nearest land the astounding
fact of the sudden collapse of the Rustleton marriage,
owing to the arrival on the scene of a previous
husband of the lady.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ach Himmel!</span></i> it is klorious!” gasped Funkstein,
waving a pale blue paper, “I haf here Petsie’s reply
to de offer of de Syindigate—she comes to de Vest End
Theatre; at an advanced salary returns—and de house
will be cram-jammed to de doors for anoder tree hoondred
berformances. It is an ill vind dot to nopody plows
goot, mark my vords!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lord Pomphrey had just given utterance to a similar
sentiment; Rustleton, on the other side of the Atlantic,
had previously arrived at a like conclusion. Mr. Boman
had entertained the same view from the outset of affairs.
Petsie—again Le Poyntz—realizing the gigantic advertisement
that the resurrection of her first proprietor
involved, was gradually becoming reconciled to the situation.
When all the characters of a tale are made content,
is it not time the narrative came to a close?</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>“CLOTHES—AND THE MAN—!”</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The smoking-room of the Younger Sons’ Club, the bow-windows
of which command a view of Piccadilly, contained
at the hour of two-thirty its full complement of
habitual nicotians, who, seated in the comfortable armchairs,
recumbent on the leather divans, or grouped upon
the hearthrug, lent their energies with one accord to
the thickening of the atmosphere.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hambridge Ost, a small, drab-hued man with a triangular
face, streakily-brushed hair, champagne-bottle
shoulders, and feet as narrow as boot-trees without the
detachable side-pieces, invariably encased in the shiniest
of patent leathers,—Hambridge, from behind a large
green cigar, was giving a select audience of very young
and callow listeners the benefit of his opinions upon
dress.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If I proposed to jot down the small events of my insignificant
private life, dear fellers, or had the gift—supposing
I did commit ’em to paper—of makin’ ’em interesting
...” said Hambridge, raising his eyebrows
to the edge of his carefully parted hair and letting them
down again, “I don’t mind telling you, dear fellers,
that the resultant volume or two would mark an epoch
in autobiographical literature. But, like the violet—so
to put it—I have, up to the present, preferred to blush
unseen. Not that the violet <em>can</em> blush anything but purple—or
blue in frosty weather, but the simile has up to
now always held good in literature. Lord Pomphrey—a
man appreciative to a degree of the talents of his relatives—has
said to me a thousand times if one, ‘Confound
you, Hambridge, why is not that, or this, or the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>other, so to put it, in print?’ But Pomphrey may be
partial——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, no!” exclaimed, in a very deep bass, a very
young man in a knitted silk waistcoat and a singularly
brilliant set of pimples. “No, no!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Much obliged, dear fellow,” said Hambridge, hoisting
his eyebrows and letting them drop in his characteristic
manner. “Some of my views may possess originality—even
freshness when expressed, as I invariably express
’em, in a perfectly commonplace manner.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, no!” again exclaimed the pimply-faced owner of
the deep bass voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“As to the Ethics of the Crinoline, now,” went on
Hambridge, “I observe that an energetic effort is being
made—in a certain quarter and amongst a certain <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coterie</span></i>—to
revive the discarded hoops of 1855–66. They
did their best to impart a second vitality to the Early
Victorian poke-bonnet some years ago. Why did the
effort fail, dear fellers? Because, with their accompanying
garniture of modesty, blushes were considered necessary
to the feminine equipment at the date I have mentioned.
And because blushes—I speak on the most reliable
authority—are more difficult to simulate than
tears. Also because, looking down the pink silk-lined
tunnel of the poke-bonnet of 1855–66, it was impossible
for you, as an ordinary male creature, to decide whether
the rosy glow invading the features of the woman you
adored—we adored women, dear fellows, at that period—was
genuine or the reverse. There you have in a nutshell
the reason why the poke-bonnet was not welcomed
at the dawn of the twentieth century. Modesty and
blushes, dear fellers, are out of date.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Hambridge leaned back in his chair with an air of
mild triumph, running his movable eye—the left was
rigidly fixed behind his monocle—over the faces of the
listeners.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>“Will the woman of the Twentieth Century willingly
enclose her legs—they were limbs in 1855–66—once more
in the steel-barred calico cage, fifteen feet in circumference,
if not more, that contained the woman of the
Early Victorian Era? Dear fellers, the question furnishes
material for an interestin’ debate. In my young
days there was no sittin’ in ladies’ pockets, no cosy-cornering,
so to put it. You invariably kept at a respectful
distance from the young creature whom you,
more or less ardently—we could be ardent in those days—desired
to woo and win, simply because you couldn’t
get nearer. You didn’t approach her mother for permission
to pay your addresses-her mother was encased
in a similar panoply. You went to her father, because
you could get at him—there you have the plain, simple
reason of the custom of ‘askin’ Papa.’ And if you
were reprehensibly desirous of eloping with another
fellow’s wife, you didn’t express your wish in words.
You wrote a letter invitin’ her to fly with you—we called
it flying in those days—and dropped it in the post. If
the lady disapproved, she dropped you. If not, she
bolted with you in a chaise with four or a pair—and
even then her crinoline kept you at a distance. You
were no more at liberty to put your arm round her waist
than if the eye of Early Victorian Society had been
glued upon you.</p>

<p class='c009'>“To put forward another reason <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">contra</span></i> the reacceptance
of the crinoline by the Woman of To-day, dear fellers,
the Woman of To-day can swim. Therefore, the
advantage of being dressed practically in a lifebuoy,
does not appeal to her as it did early in the previous
reign. I could quote you an instance of an accident
which occurred to the Dover and Calais paddle-wheel
steam-packet, on board which I happened to be a passenger,
which, owing to the negligence of the captain,
ran ashore upon a sandbank half a mile from the pier.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>The first boat which was lowered was filled with lady
passengers, all in crinolines. It was swamped by a
wave which washed over the stern. The steersman and
the sailors who were rowing were unluckily snatched to
a watery grave, poor fellows. Not so the women passengers
of the swamped boat, dear creatures, who simply
floated, keeping hold of one another’s scarves and bonnet-strings,
and so forth, until they could be picked up
and conveyed ashore. Not one of ’em could swim a
stroke—and all were saved, thanks to the crinoline in
which each was attired. But, useful as under certain
circumstances the birdcage may be, the Twentieth Century
Woman will never be tempted back into it. She
has learned what it is to have muscles and to use ’em,
dear fellers! and the era of languid inertia is over for
her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will add, dear fellers, that in these drab and uncommonly
dismal days of early December, the dash of
color now perceptible in the clothes of the best dressed
men present at social functions of the superior sort, adds
largely to the cheeriness of the scene. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cela me fait cet
effet</span></i>, dear fellers, but of course I may be wrong. And
the first man to adopt and appear in the newest style in
evenin’ dress—a bright blue coat of fine faced cloth,
with black velvet collar, velvet cuffs, and silk facin’s,
worn with trousers of the same material, braided with
black down the side seams, and a V-cut vest of white
Irish silk poplin-has realized a fortune through it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A well-known man, dear fellers, connected with two
old Tory families of the highest distinction, educated at
Eton, popular at the University-where he did not allow
his love of study to interfere with the more serious
pursuit of sport—d’ye take me? Suppose we call him
Eric de Peauchamp-Walmerdale. His marriage took
place yesterday at St. Neot’s, Knightsbridge, the sacred
edifice bein’ decorated with large lilies and white chrysanthemums,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>and the gatherin’ of guests surprisingly
large—the biggest crush of the Season as yet. There
were six little girl-bridesmaids in pale blue, with diamond
lockets, and the bride’s train was carried by four
pages, also in pale blue, with gold-headed canes. As
for the bride, considerin’ her age—a cool seventy—surprisin’,
dear fellers! Only daughter and heiress of an
ex-butler, who invented a paste for cleanin’ plate, patented
it, and became a millionaire, Isaac Shyne, Esq.,
M.P., of The Beeches, Wopsley, and 710, Park Lane,
deceased ten years ago at the ripe age of ninety.</p>

<p class='c009'>“De Peauchamp-Walmerdale’s married sister lived
next door to the rich Miss Shyne, who practically went
nowhere, and only received her Nonconformist minister,
and a few whist-playin’ friends of the same denomination
on certain specified evenin’s. House absolutely
Early Victorian—walnut-wood drawing-room suite, upholstered
in green silk rep, mahogany and brown leather
for the dinin’-room. Berlin woolwork curtains, worked
by the mistress of the house, at all the front windows.
Three parrots, two poodles, and a pair of King Charles
spaniels of the obsolete miniature breed. Maid-servants—all
elderly, butler like a bishop, uncommon good cellar
of gouty old Madeiras and sherries, laid down by the defunct
Shyne, awful collection of pictures by Smith,
Jones, Brown, and Robinson, splendid plate, too heavy
to lift. And a fortune of one hundred and fifty thousand
in the most reliable Home Rails and breweries, besides
an estate of sixty thousand acres in Crannshire,
and the title deeds of the Park Lane house.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It came—the idea of bringing Miss Shyne and De
Peauchamp-Walmerdale together—like a flash of inspiration—as
the dear feller’s sister, Lady Tewsminster,
told me yesterday when people had struggled up after
the Psalm, and yawned through the address, <em>not</em> delivered
by a Nonconformist, but by the Bishop of Baxterham;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>and while the choir were singin’, ‘O Perfect Love!’
She was frightfully cast down when she discovered
through her maid, who had scraped, under orders, an acquaintance
with Miss Shyne’s elderly confidential attendant,
that her lady objected to young gentlemen—couldn’t
endure the sight, so to put it, of anything masculine
under fifty, or without a bulge under the waistcoat,
and a bald top to its head. Further inquiries elicited
that Miss Shyne had had a disappointment in early
life, and wore at the back of an old-fashioned cameo
brooch, representin’ the ‘Choice of Paris,’ the portrait
on ivory of a handsome young man with fair hair, the
livin’ image of Eric de Peauchamp-Walmerdale, in a
light blue tail-coat, with a black velvet collar and gold
buttons, holding a King Charles spaniel of the miniature
breed under his arm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dear fellers, Lady Tewsminster, the evening upon
which she received this item of information, knew no
more than a newly-born infant what she was going to
do with it. As happens to most of us, she mentally filed
it for further reference, and getting into her gown, her
diamonds, and her evening <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coiffure</span></i>—those Etruscan
rolled curls are extremely becoming to a woman of pronounced
outlines, and there’s only one place in London,
she tells me, where they can be bought or redressed—went
down to the drawing-room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A small but select party had been invited for the
evenin’, including, on the feminine side, an American
heiress on the lookout for a husband with a title—or,
at least, the next heir to one-a handsome widow with
a fairly decent jointure, and a couple of marriageable
girls with almost quite respectable <em>dots</em>. From these,
carefully collected on approval by a devoted sister, De
Peauchamp-Walmerdale might, who knows? have selected
a life partner, and sunk into the obscurity of
moderate means for ever, had it not occurred to him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>upon that particular evening—do you take me, dear fellers?—to
array himself in the latest cry of modern masculine
evening dress.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He was standing on the hearthrug when Lady Tewsminster
entered, a tall, slim, youthful figure, fair-haired
and complexioned, and quite uncommonly handsome, in
his light blue coat with the black velvet collar, braided
accompaniments, and pearl-buttoned, watch-chainless,
white silk vest.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘How do you like me, Ju, old girl?’ he said, coming
to kiss her. ‘I’ve come to dine in character as our
great-grandfather. Awful fool I feel, but my tailor
insisted on my wearin’ ’em, and as I owe the brute a
frightful bill I thought I’d best appease him by givin’
in.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“The gilded Early Victorian frame of the high mantel-mirror
behind De Peauchamp-Walmerdale had the
effect of being a frame, if you foller me, out of which,
the figure of the dear feller had stepped. A cameo
brooch shot into the mind of Lady Tewsminster, above it
the long narrow face and dowdy black lace bonnet of
the heiress, Miss Jane Ann Shyne. A plan of campaign
was instantly formulated in the mind of that surprising
woman. She stepped to one of the windows commandin’
Park Lane, drew aside the blind, and saw, paddlin’ up
and down on the rainy pavement outside, the waterproofed
figure of Miss Shyne’s confidential maid, taking
the King Charles spaniels and the poodles for their customary
evenin’ ta-ta. Instantly she touched the bell,
sent for her maid and said to her in a rapid undertone,
‘Johnson, ten pounds are yours if you can steal one
of Miss Shyne’s pet King Charles spaniels while their
attendant is not looking. There is no risk—I shall send
the creature back in ten minutes. Will you undertake
this? Yes? Very well, go and get the beast.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“The maid, Johnson, departed swiftly, the area-gate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>clicked, and Lady Tewsminster, feverish with the great
project boiling under her transformation, paced the
drawing-room until she heard the second click of the
gate. She swept down the stairs to meet Johnson, in
whose black silk apron struggled the smallest of the
King Charles spaniels. ‘Did the woman see?’ whispered
the mistress. ‘Not a bit of her, my lady,’ returned the
maid. ‘She was gossiping with the District Police-Inspector
about a burglary they’ve had three doors
away. So I got Tottles—that’s his name, my lady-quite
easy, not being on a lead.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“Telling the maid the promised ten pounds should be
hers that night, Lady Tewsminster snatched the struggling
‘Tottles’ from the enveloping apron and swept
back to her drawing-room to carry out her plan.
‘Peachie dear,’ she said as she entered, ‘it would be
frightfully sweet of you if you would run in next door
and carry this little beast to its owner, Miss Shyne.
Insist on seeing her; do not give the animal into any
other hands; do not wear your hat or an overcoat. I
am firm upon this; and remember,’ she fixed her large,
expressive eyes full upon her brother’s face, ‘remember,
she has <em>nearly two hundred thousand pounds, and your
fate is in your own hands!... Go!</em>’</p>

<p class='c009'>“Rather bewildered by Lady Tewsminster’s almost
tragic address, De Peauchamp-Walmerdale took the
wriggling Tottles, left the house, and carried out his instructions
to the letter. The loss of Tottles had been
discovered. Miss Shyne’s establishment was topsy-turvy
when he arrived, servants tearing up and down
stairs, the confidential attendant in tears on a hall chair,
Miss Shyne in hysterics in her Early Victorian boudoir,
the remaining dogs harking their heads off, and the very
devil to pay. But the arrival of De Peauchamp-Walmerdale,
dear fellers, caused a lull in the storm. Faithful
to his instructions, he refused to give up the dog, except
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>to its mistress, and after a feint or two of departure,
Miss Shyne gave in and ordered her fate, as it
turned out to be—d’ye foller me?—to be shown upstairs.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Early Victorian drawing-room, with the green
rep furniture and the Berlin woolwork curtains—a pattern
of macaws and dahlias, I understood—was in partial
darkness. Only the wax candles in the crystal candelabra
on the marble mantelshelf were alight, no electric
illuminations bein’ permitted on the premises.</p>

<p class='c009'>“De Peauchamp-Walmerdale—dog under his arm—took
up a commandin’ position on the hearthrug, also
worked in Berlin wool, in front of a small, mysterious
and palely-twinkling fire. As he did so the foldin’ doors
opposite, communicating with the boudoir, slowly
opened, and Miss Jane Ann Shyne, spinster, aged seventy,
saw before her the long-dead romance of her youth,
resuscitated from the ashes of—wherever long-dead romances
are deposited, dear fellers. There was a faint,
feminine scream—quite Early Victorian in character—a
rustle of old-fashioned satins—an outburst of joyous
barks from Tottles, a strong, bewildering perfume of
lavender water (triple extract), and the old lady sank,
literally sank, upon the white Irish poplin vest that
added style and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cachet</span></i> to De Peauchamp-Walmerdale’s
uncommonly fetchin’ costume.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What more, dear fellers? The couple were united
yesterday at St. Neot’s, Knightsbridge. Every penny is
settled on De Peauchamp-Walmerdale, and Lady Tewsminster
says she can now die happy, her dear boy being
provided for, for life. She naturally claims the honors
of the affair! Quite so, but without the clothes
where would the man have been? D’ye foller me, dear
fellers? In my poor opinion, the principal factor in the
making of De Peauchamp-Walmerdale’s fortune was the
Man Behind the Shears. Do you foller me? So glad!
Thought you would.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Let us be consistent,’” said Lady Pomphrey, her
three saddle-bag chins quivering with emotion, “‘or let
us die’—that is what I have always said. Here is my
only niece, Wendoleth Caer-Brydglingbury, goes—actually
goes—and marries a Liberal Member of Parliament
in a red necktie—who makes speeches in townhalls
and tents, and things, to masses of people, all about
pulling down the House of Lords and abolishing the
Peerage, and absolutely declines to allow his wife to
drop her title. To you—so intimate a friend, don’t you
know?—I may say in confidence I am sickened. I cannot
imagine what the world is coming to. I could wish
to die and leave it, were it not that Jane and Charlotte
are still unmarried, and I have promised to present three
of the <em>sweetest</em> girls—well-bred Americans of the best
type, without a trace of accent—at the first Drawing-room
of the Winter Season. And the family diamonds
are being reset in view of Rustleton’s approaching marriage—a
union satisfactory from every point of view,
especially a mother’s.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lady Pomphrey paused for breath, and the intimate
friend-they had met at Bad Smellstein a fortnight previously
while taking little early morning walks, and
drinking little glasses of excessively nauseous waters
warranted to correct the most aristocratic acidity—the
intimate friend murmured something sympathetic.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course, I might have <em>known</em> one <em>could</em> look to <em>you</em>
for comprehension and all that sort of thing,” said Lady
Pomphrey, graciously bending her head, which was enveloped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>in a large mushroom hat of blue straw tied
down all round with a drab silk veil, and patting the
intimate friend upon the knee with the stick of her celebrated
green silk sunshade. “One of those delightful
literary creatures-was it Algernon Meredith or George
Swinburne?—has termed friendship ‘the marriage of
true minds.’ Ever since the Hambridge-Osts introduced
us—in a thunderstorm—at the firework display in the
Park in honor of the Grand Duke’s birthday—and being
Sunday, I will <em>own</em> that the nerve-shattering meteorological
demonstrations that drove us to shelter in that
extremely leaky Chinese pavilion seemed to me but a
judgment upon German Sabbath-breakers—ours has
been such a union. Cemented by your helpfulness in
the matter of sandbags for a rattling window—Lord
Pomphrey is completely impervious to all such nerve-shattering
tortures, and will sleep happily in his cabin
on the yacht in Cowes Roads through a Royal Naval Review—and
your timely ministrations with soda-mint lozenges
when acute indigestion virtually prostrated me
after a homicidal <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">plat</span></i> of eels with cranberry-sauce, of
which I foolishly partook at the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">table d’hôte</span></i>. The mysteriousness
of it allured me. I wished for once to feel
like a German. Now I feel assured their extraordinary
diet accounts for much that is abstruse and metaphysical
in the national character. For you cannot possibly be
normal if you are fed upon abnormal things. And I am
grateful that Rustleton has never shown himself in the
least susceptible to the attractions of their women. I
know—almost quite intimately—a Grand Duchess who
has brought up every one of her nine young daughters
upon red-cabbage soup, with sausage-meat balls and
dumplings; and somehow it is suggested in the girls’
complexions and figures—<em>especially</em> the dumplings.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The friend tittered. Lady Pomphrey placed upon the
seat beside her a straw handbag containing a Tauchnitz
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>edition of the last new Mudie novel, a black fan, a large
bottle of frightfully strong salts, several spare pocket-handkerchiefs,
several indelible-ink pencils, and a quantity
of obsolete railway tickets, and became more confidential
than ever.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Had I been consulted by destiny when the arrangement
of Rustleton’s matrimonial future came <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sur le
tapis</span></i> I could not—with my expiring breath I would repeat
this—<em>could not</em> be more completely satisfied. It
began by his hating her.... She hit him on the nose
with a diabolo in June at Ranelagh, and, ‘Mother,’ he
said afterwards to me—his upper lip perfectly rigid
with wounded dignity—‘I should have greatly preferred
to have been born in the days of “Coningsby,” or “Lothair.”
Muscular young women create in me a feeling
of <em>positive aversion</em>!’ He found her agitating even at
that early stage of affairs? How subtle of you to <em>see</em>
that!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The flattered friend murmured an interrogation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who is she?” repeated Lady Pomphrey. “But
surely the newspapers?... You suffer too acutely
from dancing spots in the field of vision ever to read
when undergoing a cure?... Poor dear, I can feel
for you. She is the Hon. Céline Twissing—will be Baroness
Twissing of Hopsacks in her own right when old
Lord Twissing dies. He insisted upon <em>that</em> arrangement
in the interests of his only child; when the intimation
was conveyed from a Certain Quarter that the Jubilee
Baronetcy he already enjoyed would be changed into a
Peerage did he encourage the idea. Quite a bluff old
English type, and I must say in hospitality Imperial.
‘Twissing’s Bonded Breweries.’... A colossal fortune,
and that <em>sweet</em> girl is to inherit nearly the whole.
Shall I say that my heart went out to her from the first
instant I saw her? As a mother yourself, you will understand!
Here comes the young woman with the tray
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>for our glasses. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ja, bitte, Ich danke Sie....</span></i> You
<em>don’t</em> mean to tell me the creature is a Cockney?...
How distressing! I may be fanciful, possibly I am,”
said Lady Pomphrey, “but I do prefer my surroundings
to be congruous and in tone. I’m sure you feel what
I convey? You do? How nice that is!...”</p>

<p class='c009'>The friend smiled and inaudibly murmured something.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course,” cried Lady Pomphrey, “you’re on
thorns to hear all about Rustleton’s love-match. As I
told you, Céline Twissing—the <em>Christian</em> name has been
Gallicized from Selina—and why on earth not? <em>Céline</em>
is an expert at diabolo. It’s a knack, sending these little
black and red demons as high as a house, or into
your neighbor’s eye; and she is a talented as well as
a charming girl. With three languages, several sciences,
a system of physical-culture exercises, golf, tennis, and
the laws of hockey at her finger-ends, she would have
gone far in these days of violent recreations and brusque
manners, even without a <em>dot</em>. Masculine? Oh <em>dear no</em>!
Perhaps deficient in reverence for what <em>we</em> were taught
to believe in as the superior sex. Perhaps lacking in
feminine <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">finesse</span></i>. I <em>have</em> heard it said that the girl of
the twentieth century cannot cajole, and is ignorant how
to be alluring. Perhaps it is a pity. The woman who
has a gift of managing difficult people, smoothing absurd
people down, and being perfectly amiable to the absolutely
objectionable is practically priceless as a greaser
of the social cog-wheels. Now Céline calls that sort of
woman, plumply and plainly, a hypocrite.... But is
it not a woman’s <em>duty</em> to be a hypocrite, if telling the
truth to everybody makes the world a place of gnashing?”
demanded Lady Pomphrey, making her eyebrows
climb up out of sight under the shadow of her mushroom
hat.</p>

<p class='c009'>The compliant friend assented.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You understand, then, how dissonant was the chord
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>Céline Twissing struck in Rustleton. With his Plantagenet
dash in the blood, his hereditary intolerance of
anything smacking of vulgarity, his medieval attitude of
chivalry towards Woman, his Early Victorian dislike of
the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">outré</span></i> and the <em>bizarre</em>, he frankly found her intolerable.
‘In a drawing-room,’ he said to me in confidence,
‘that girl reminds me of a Polar bear in a hothouse.’
Where the boy could have seen one I cannot imagine—probably
it was only a young man’s daring figure of
speech. Shall we walk about a little? I think I felt a
twinge.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The friend agreed, and, gently ambling up and down
the Kreuzbrunnen Promenade, Lady Pomphrey continued
her narrative.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Rustleton said she was a New Girl of the worst type.
Then came the diabolo affair, which, considering Céline’s
remarkable knack, I cannot think accidental. The
bridge of Rustleton’s nose was seriously contused, and
his monocle was shattered—fortunately without danger
to the eye. He took no revenge beyond an epigram,
quite worthy of La Rochefou—what’s his name?...
She is keen on dancing, unlike other muscular girls;
and said so in my boy’s near vicinity. ‘Why not? She
has hops in her blood,’ he uttered. Of course, a little
bird carried it to her ear.... How d’ye do, Lady
Frederica? How d’ye do, Count Pyffer? I quite agree
with you.... Piercing winds, varied by muggy airlessness
and a distressingly relaxing warmth, <em>have</em> made
the last eight days intolerable.... My dear, where
was I when I left off?” The suffering friend indicated
the point. Lady Pomphrey continued:</p>

<p class='c009'>“And <em>after all</em> they have come together. Quite a
romance. If a mother’s prayers have any influence,
... and I am old-fashioned enough to believe they have....
But I knew Rustleton too well to breathe a hint
of my hopes. I did not stoop to intrigue, as some mothers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>would, to bring the young people together. But
dearest Jane, who is always my right hand, conceived
a devoted friendship for Céline just at the psychological
moment, and owing to that she and Rustleton were <em>constantly</em>
thrown in each other’s way. Céline quite exerted
herself to be overwhelmingly unpleasant. Jane
says that during a bicycling excursion in the neighborhood
of our place at Cluckham-Pomphrey, she offered to
help him to lift his machine over a stile, and would have
done it unaided and alone if Rustleton had not peremptorily
seized the frame-bar, gripping both her hands in
his. On Jane’s authority, she crimsoned to the hat,
throwing him off like a feather, and, mounting her machine,
was out of sight in an instant. He was icily sarcastic
on the subject of muscular young women all the
way home, and limited his dinner to clear soup and a
single cutlet with dry toast, while Céline went through
all the courses in her usual thoroughgoing way. They
are not in the least ashamed to eat, do you notice?—these
golfing, hockey-playing, open-air young people....
Now you and I can recall placing a solid barrier
of five o’clock cake and muffins between undue appetite
and the eight o’clock dinner, at which we merely toyed
with our knives and forks, trusting to our maids to have
a tray of cold eatables ready in the bedroom for consumption
while our hair was being brushed. Of <em>course</em>!
‘but <em>these</em> girls devour at tea, <em>wolf</em> at dinner’—I quote
Rustleton—‘and probably stodge sandwiches and cold
chicken and chocolate-wafers before they plunge into
their beds. When there, how they must snore!’</p>

<p class='c009'>“His eye gleamed with such feverish malignancy as he
said this, that I involuntarily dropped a quantity of
stitches in the silk necktie I was knitting for him—a
soothing neutral shade not calculated to call attention
to the tinge of bile in his complexion—and exclaimed,
‘Good Heavens!’ He immediately begged my pardon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>and bade me ‘good-night,’ whispering that he had arranged
to shoot over the lower sixty acres with Stubbins,
the head keeper—purely as a filial duty, Pomphrey
not feeling robust enough to undertake it this year....</p>

<p class='c009'>“Whether it was my having breathed a hint of this
to Jane—who is, as a rule, a <em>grave</em> for chance confidence—or
whether Miss Twissing had overheard, how can I
say? But she and Stubbins were waiting for my boy
on the following morning, Stubbins—who loathes sporting
women—in a state of complacency that only a five-pound
note could have brought about. Her beautiful
Bond-street self-ejecting breechloader, her cap, tweeds,
and gaiters were the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dernier cri</span></i>, and with the coolest
self-possession she wiped my poor boy’s eye over and
over again. Out of thirty brace of birds before luncheon
only three and a half fell to his gun, and <em>those</em> were of
the red-legged French description, ‘bred for duffers to
blaze at,’ according to Lord Pomphrey. Rustleton went
up to town that night, charging Jane with all sorts of
civil messages for Miss Twissing, and slept at his Club,
which was being painted and disagreed with him excessively.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The friend sighed sympathy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Even with every door and window open and a flat
dish full of milk upon the washstand,” said Lady Pomphrey,
taking the friend’s arm and emphasizing her utterances
with the green sunshade, “white paint permeates
my whole being in a way that is perfectly indescribable.
My son inherits my receptiveness—perhaps
my weakness-indeed, he came into the world at Cluckham-Pomphrey
during an early visit of ours, subsequent
to spring-cleaning, where, owing to an unhappy facility
possessed by Lord Pomphrey of being easily persuaded
by self-interested persons, the hall screen, grand staircase,
and all the Jacobean paneling had been covered by
the local decorator with a creamy-hued, turpentiny and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>glutinous mixture known as ‘Eggster’s Exquisite Enamel.’
It cost a fortune to get off again, and some of
it still lingers in the crevices of the carving. My basket....
It is a little cumbrous, but I really couldn’t
think of letting you.... Well then, dear friend, if
you insist.... Now for the really remarkable ending
of my boy’s story.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He flew to his cousin for consolation. Now, Wendoleth
Caer-Brydglingbury is extremely sympathetic. Only
for the color of her hair-a violent Boadicean red, almost
purple in some lights—Rustleton and she—but I
am devoutly thankful things have turned out as they
<em>have</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘A sea cruise,’ said Wendoleth promptly, ‘will get
the white paint out of your system quicker than anything
I know; and your morbid feeling of vexation with
this girl, impatience of her persistency in continuing to
exist, and so forth, will vanish with other things. Mr.
Mudge,’—the person she has since married,—‘has kindly
asked Papa and myself to join his party on board the
steam-yacht <em>Fifi</em> for a trip to Lisbon, Madeira, and the
Canaries; join us. I assure you a complete welcome and
at least half a cabin.’ Rustleton recognized the cousinly
kindness in Wendoleth’s proposal, accepted, and went
with her and Todmoxen—the Earl is still robust, but
not what he was in the ’seventies, nor is it to be expected—down
to Southampton to join the <em>Fifi</em>. Mudge
is Liberal member for the North Clogger Division of
Mudderpool. But for a crimson necktie—the Party
badge—and a habit of hanging on to his own coat-lapels
when conversing, he is almost quite presentable, and,
like all those people who begin by not having twopence,
he is astonishingly rich. His welcome to Rustleton was
cordial in the extreme. But when Rustleton found Lord
Twissing and his daughter already on board, discovered
that he was to share Twissing’s cabin, and that Céline
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>slept in the one next door, he was dismayed. He would
have excused himself and left the <em>Fifi</em> only that she was
already on her way. Fate, like one of those curious
jelly-like creatures which wave their tentacles to attract
their prey and then clutch it and gradually absorb it,
had wrapped its feelers around my poor boy. He is
now resigned, calm, content, even happy; but when I
think how he must have suffered.... My salts. In
the basket. So kind of you, and <em>so</em> reviving.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lady Pomphrey inhaled with drooping eyelids and
sniffed at the salts-flagon from time to time as she embarked
once more upon her narrative way.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The <em>Fifi</em> anchored for the night, which promised to
be squally, in Southampton Water, about a quarter of a
mile from Hythe Pier. Depressed and discouraged, my
boy retired to his cabin, leaving the entire party screaming
over ‘Bridge’ at a number of little tables in the saloon.
He had just put on his nightalines,—pink with a
green stripe, the jacket ornamented with green braid in
loops, to match—and was attending to his teeth with a
palm-stick, when, with a terrific crash, all the electric
lights went out and the <em>Fifi</em> was plunged in darkness.
I shudder when I realize the awfulness of all that. Don’t
you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The friend supplied a shudder expressly manufactured
for the purpose.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A Welsh collier steamer, the <em>Rattletrap</em>, from Penwryg,
had run down Mr. Mudge’s yacht, becoming firmly
embedded in the hull of the craft—the details are
graven on my memory,” said Lady Pomphrey impressively—“immediately
forward of the engine-room. The
crew turned out—not into the sea, but out of their hammocks—the
‘Bridge’ players rushed in confusion upon
deck. In their evening dresses, without being even able
to save a bag from below, Mr. Mudge’s party were
dragged over the grimy bows of the collier. The crew
scrambled after. The captain of the <em>Rattletrap</em>, having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>ascertained that the <em>Fifi</em> was rapidly filling, and that all
her passengers, as he thought, were safe on board his
vessel, was about to give the signal from the bridge to
reverse engines when, with an appalling scream a lithe
young girl in a crêpe de Chine evening wrap embroidered
with roses and turtle-doves—quite symbolic when
you think of it—leaped back upon the deck of the <em>Fifi</em>
and disappeared below. Guess who she was, and whither
she had gone? You can? You do? What romance in
real life, isn’t it? Céline Twissing had missed Rustleton,
and, knowing that he occupied the cabin next to her own,
had rushed below to save him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He had rung for his man and was waiting calmly to
be dressed, when she burst in the door with her shoulder—have
you ever noticed her shoulders?—and shrieked to
him to come on deck and be saved. Wrapped in a Scotch
plaid which he had hastily thrown over his pyjamas at
the moment of her entrance, he defied her, rebuked her
immodesty in entering a gentleman’s dressing-room unannounced,
ordered her to quit the cabin and go back
to her father. When properly attired to appear before
ladies, my boy, ever chivalrous and delicate-minded, said
he would board the <em>Rattletrap</em>. ‘Don’t you feel that this
yacht is water-logged?’ screamed Céline Twissing.
‘Don’t you know she’ll sink under our feet in another
minute? Come on deck at <em>once</em>, you duffing little precisian,
unless you want me to carry you!’ He retorted
with contempt. She instantly seized him in her muscular
arms—have you ever noticed her arms?—threw him,
Scotch plaid and all, over her shoulder, carried him up
the yacht’s companion-ladder, and amidst the cheers of
the united crews of the <em>Fifi</em> and the <em>Rattletrap</em>, handed
him over the bulwarks to the men of the collier. Then
she followed, the captain gave the order to go astern, the
collier reversed her engines, the water rushed into the
yacht, and she sank instantly. All that can be seen of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>her to-day is her masts. And Céline Twissing and my
boy are to be made one at St. George’s, Hanover Square,
in the first week of the Winter Season. Céline will be
married in white satin and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mousseline</span></i> trimmed with silver
embroidery, and she goes away in a gown of putty-colored
<em>velvelise</em>—the new stuff. I believe she secretly
adored Rustleton from the very beginning, and he, I feel,
is reconciled to the inscrutable appointments of Providence.
<em>How</em> we have been chattering, haven’t we?
Time for luncheon now. Oh, I pray, no carp in beer,
or eels with currant jelly. But one never knows. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Au
revoir</span></i>, dear! <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Au revoir!</span></i>” And Lady Pomphrey put
up her green sunshade and sailed away.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
